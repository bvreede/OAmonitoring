Design/methodology/approach Through an extensive literature review and a close consideration of multiple sources, this paper analyzes fashion, tradition and knowledge creation through the lens of museum and company archives. A section on museum archives analyzes the role of fashion in the museum and the use of technology in cataloging, online resources and exhibitions for knowledge transfer of fashion history. The second half of the paper considers the relationship between heritage, company archives and technology in branding and consumer engagement. Findings The paper summarizes recent scholarship in the fields of fashion archives and demonstrates the still current importance of heritage in generating new design and exhibition practices. Despite having its roots in the past, heritage demonstrates continuity with the present and looks to the future with the same devotion and commitment, thus guaranteeing quality and authenticity for both museum collections and company productions.

Therefore, the so-called ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"" has been described as a model where new modes of production and consumption will dramatically transform all major industrial systems; it has been targeted by many governmental plans as a goal for a sustainable future. While general frameworks describing 4.0 paradigm are codified and accessible, implementation strategies and their implications on specific local and sectorial systems are largely unexplored. Starting from this assumption, this paper aims to provide insights on the current state of the art and major trends of the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"", possibly identifying its impacts on the textile and apparel industry. Design/methodology/approach From a methodological standpoint, the study approaches the topic from the perspective of fashion domain experts which can contribute, with a positioning essay, to better understanding Industry 4.0 (I4.0) implementation within their specific domain. This experts' perspective is enriched by several descriptive case studies (Yin, 1984) offering examples and insights on possible implementation of I4.0 solutions in fashion industry, also showing the potential of a design driven perspective. Findings Starting from a synthesis of I4.0 framework and principles, the paper aims at showing their impacts on business units, processes and components within the specific context of the fashion industry. Through emerging evidences detected by experts' domain perspective and exemplified by several descriptive cases, it offers a comprehensive overview of the potential implications of the Forth Industrial Revolution on this specific business. The picture drafted clearly shows how digital transformation, properly driven, could reshape the fashion industry into a more sustainable and truly customer-driven business. But, it also underlines criticalities and slowness of adoption by traditional established brands and companies. As a result, being focused on on-going phenomena, highly unexplored, it shows possible trajectories, enabling an effective transformation of textile and apparel industry embracing the I4.0 paradigm. Originality/value The paper has a broad perspective and could offer insights to different audiences, which could effectively contribute to a positive transition, to scholars and academics, who might want to better address the implementation of I4.0 model into real economic and social context, focusing on medium - long-term implications and showing innovation pathways which are still unexplored, second to practitioners, who are usually immersed into strict silos of competences and business functions and can start to build new bridges and interconnection within the system, taking advantages of I4.0 potential, finally to policy-makers who can better shape development frameworks targeted to specific industries whose features require peculiar approaches and actions.";"[Bertola, Paola] Polytech Univ Milan, Design Dept, Milan, Italy; [Teunissen, Jose] London Coll Fash, London, England";Bertola, P (reprint author), Polytech Univ Milan, Design Dept, Milan, Italy.;;;;;;56;3;3;19;79;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1560-6074;;;RES J TEXT APPAR;Res.

Given the fact that quantitative studies have become increasingly visible in literary studies during the last decades, due to various influences such as Franco Moretti's theoretical branch or Matthew L. Jockers' macroanalysis and its appropriation in digital humanities, a pertinent study on this methodology is necessary because: 1) it can contribute to a better understanding of the role it has had in this domain and 2) it can bring better insight into its possible use in our country. For these reasons, this essay is seeking to present a history of the quantitative methodological approach as applied on macro scales (therefore, the main domains discussed in this essay are the sociology of literature and digital humanities) and to describe the ways it has influenced or may further influence the study of literature in Romania.;[Balici, Mihnea] Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Letters, Cluj Napoca, Romania;Balici, M (reprint author), Babes Bolyai Univ, Fac Letters, Cluj Napoca, Romania.;;;;;;22;0;0;0;0;UNIV BABES-BOLYAI, FAC LETTERS, PHANTASMA CTR IMAGINATION STUDIES;CLUJ-NAPOCA;STR HOREA 31, CLUJ-NAPOCA, 400202, ROMANIA;;2457-8827;;METACRITIC J COMP ST;Metacritic J.

In contrast to other studies of the DH literature that focus on publications in the west, this study examines 129 papers published in the proceedings of the International Conferences of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities that were held in Taiwan between 2009 and 2016. In all, 236 individual authors from 15 countries contributed at least one paper; 50 domains were represented. Three East Asian countries (Taiwan, China, and Japan) show a dominating presence, and top three domains (computer science, history, and Chinese) have the highest numbers of participants and highest numbers of first authors. Unlike their counterparts in the humanities, the papers in the study have a much higher percentage of collaborative works. More than half of the papers that are collaborative works are interdisciplinary, but only one-fifth involve international collaboration. Proportionally, computer scientists' participation rate decreases and humanists' rate increases, however modestly, from 2012 onward. The study also investigates digital technology's impact on DH in various stages of the information lifecycle. More than two-thirds of the papers discuss technology's impact in the area of consuming data from digital collections for various purposes, with the impact on building retrieval systems/online platforms coming in second at 26.6%. Among different years, the first year is exceptional in showing high interest in the impact on building digital collections, building knowledge organization systems, and building retrieval systems but low interest in the impact on data consumption.

My proposal is exemplified by the Industrial Technology Research Institute of Taiwan's Flow of Qi (2007), which uses ultra wide band technology that instantly transforms the data of a pair of participants' real-time breath into the replication of calligraphy master-works projected onto the floor in front of the participants. To explore how efficiency of breath constitutes mixed reality in Flow of Qi, I draw a parallel between Qi, which is embodied as breath, and agency whereby, as discussed by Murray and Hansen, the notion of the perception-action relationship is emphasized. However, compared to agency, Qi is characterized as evoking 'the unity of the cosmos with humanity' (t'ien-jen ho-yi) because the participants are involved in a process wherein the masters used their brushstrokes to grasp the respiration of the cosmos. Therefore, employing the concepts of Chinese Qi draws out an anthropocosmic vision of mixed reality that links participants with the cosmos and manifests a Qi world-view through digital media.;[Wu, Yi-Chen] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Theater Arts, 70 Lienhai Rd, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan;Wu, YC (reprint author), Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Theater Arts, 70 Lienhai Rd, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.;;;;;;16;0;0;2;3;INTELLECT LTD;BRISTOL;THE MILL, PARNALL RD, BRISTOL, BS16 3JG, ENGLAND;1477-965X;1758-9533;;TECHNOETIC ARTS;Technoetic Arts;DEC;2018;16;3;;;;;377;386;;10.1386/tear.16.3.377_1;;;10;Humanities, Multidisciplinary;Arts & Humanities - Other Topics;HV6YV;WOS:000466129600016;;;;;07/02/2020

Three-dimensional computer graphics (3DCG) and virtual reality (VR) technologies have been applied in the field of the Digital Humanities (DH), as well as in cultural preservation, cultural heritage education, regional revitalization, tourism promotion, and so forth. This paper examines the problems of 3DCG visualization of lost Buddhist temples, focusing on historical representation and religious meaning. A 3DCG reconstruction of lost cultural heritage by an academic expert depends on their historical interpretation and imagination. Non-experts may feel that the scholarly reconstruction does not match their image. The reconstruction by the academic expert and what is desired by non-academic users, as well as academic Buddhist studies and the practical and religious studies of each Buddhist sect (shugaku), respectively correspond to the historical past and practical past introduced by Hayden White. The former should be open to future revisions and criticisms based on different interpretations of the past, while it could encourage people to stay away from an arbitrary understanding of the past, such as historical revisionism. The digital environment has altered the relationship between people and religion. There are many religious practices, including Buddhist meditation, in VR environment. In the context of Mahayana Buddhism, visualization is a meditation practice and a way of communicating with the holy things, the dead, and the past. 3DCG visualization of lost Buddhist temples could be regarded as such kind of Buddhist practice, and it might contribute to supporting the activities of some Buddhists in the digital age.;[Moro, Shigeki] Hanazono Univ, Kyoto, Japan;Moro, S (reprint author), Hanazono Univ, Kyoto, Japan.;;Moro, Shigeki/0000-0002-1764-7770;JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [JP16H03351, JP17H02327];"This paper was presented at the international conference ""Digital Humanities and Buddhism: The Future of Data Mining and Visualization"" held on June 2, 2018 at Dongguk University, Seoul.

J;Conradie, K;;;;Conradie, Karlien;;;The aesthetic disposition as psychotherapeutic quality in a mainly apathetic, digitalised environment;TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE;;;Afrikaans;Review;;;;;;"educational psychology; psychotherapist; aesthetic disposition; ontological grounding; self-transformation; digital-media culture; apathy; attentive presence; empathic sensitiveness; artistry";;"The psychotherapeutic space is characterised by, inter alia, empathetic participation, that is, sensitivity for the problematic nature of the existence and meaning of everything. The aesthetic disposition is a demand made on the therapist to be receptive to la condition humaine in an existential manner. In this article, I contend that in the face of an unbridled digital culture, the above-mentioned psychotherapeutic quality may be threatened. Furthermore, I scrutinise the nature of this concern in the light of interwoven theoretical and philosophical approaches, and of examples from poetry and literary prose. It is suggested that the training of postgraduate psychology students in general and educational psychology students in particular who have grown up with digital media ought to be reviewed. When online digital media become the predominant tool with which meaning is unlocked and interpreted it probably says something about the way people approach their world epistemologically and ontologically. In this regard, the ever-expanding digital consumerism, characterised by utility and immediacy, increasingly serves as hubris through which humanity appears to be doomed to collapse. This collapse would not necessarily mean the disappearance of Homo sapiens, but rather refers to an impoverishment of the function of language and thought in humankind's pursuit of meaning creation. Recent research contends that the rapid hybridisation (that is, the fusion of human being and android/machine) to which humankind is exposed occurs at the expense of certain knowledge-gaining and meaning-creating functions. One of these functions is the search for coherence by means of in-depth interpretation frameworks in order to steer away from chaos and fragmentation at the social and personal-psychological levels. Specifically, it concerns the impoverished role of language and thought as vital conditions for the articulation of the fine network of nuances of events and experiences. A predominantly digitalised culture in which the rich register of personal experiences is hardly given a place can lead to the ontology of existence being reduced to filtered, instant experiences and knowledge fragments stripped of their essential nuances. Another factor contributing to indifference in the context of the psychotherapist's thinking actions is the inherent fragmentation of the profession of psychology. This often makes it difficult for therapists who pursue the humanistic principles of solicitude and endeavour to fathom the greatest depths of humanity, to position themselves simultaneously within various social systems. Gardner believes ""an effective counsellor must radically change his or her perspective on a client throughout the day, viewing the client first through the client's own eyes; then through the eyes of a legal authority or insurance entity; and possibly even through the eyes of a particular agency or school, whose own policies may differ widely from the counsellor, client, or payer"" (Gardner 2016:88). According to Gardner, the orientation of metamodernism, characterised by continuous movement and reform, can serve as a conciliatory paradigm to deal with fragmentation and conflicting contexts peculiar to psychotherapeutic practice. She illustrates this fragmentation with reference, in particular, to the one-dimensional reliance on ""neo-medical strategies"" (Gardner 2016:89), namely rigid treatment plans, diagnostic criteria and DSM1 codes and categories, as opposed to a humanistic approach characterised by human autonomy and integrity. It is suggested that metamodernism as an attitude becomes a way for the educational psychologist of positioning herself in ambivalent environments by means of a to-and-fro movement between conflicting contexts and metaphysical issues related to psychology, such as good/evil, male/female, conscious/unconscious, psychological distress/prosperity, rather than a total rejection of boundaries as in postmodernism. In this article, with reference to several theories in philosophy and psychology, analytical literary discussions and recent information science research findings, I endeavour to gain clarity about how the culture of digital media relates to the need for an aesthetic disposition, specifically as a psychotherapeutic quality. In considering this, I explain how art as a direction indicator of the aesthetic disposition can be applied to advance and enrich the thinking of the psychotherapist and educational psychologist.";[Conradie, Karlien] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Opvoedkundige Sielkunde, Stellenbosch, South Africa;Conradie, K (reprint author), Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Opvoedkundige Sielkunde, Stellenbosch, South Africa.;;Conradie, Karlien/0000-0002-3301-456X;;;;39;0;0;0;5;SUID-AFRIKAANSE AKAD VIR WETENSKAP EN KUNS, SEKRETARIS;PRETORIA;P.

A pop music composition is normally made of two parts-the tune and the lyrics. Here we use a digital humanities and data science approach to examine how lyrics changed between the 1950' s and the more recent years, and apply quantitative analysis to measure these changes. To identify possible differences, we analyzed the sentiments expressed in the songs of the Billboard Hot 100, which reflects the preferences of popular music listeners and fans in each year. Automatic sentiment analysis of 6,150 Billboard 100 songs covering all the years from 1951 through 2016 shows clear and statistically significant changes in sentiments expressed through the lyrics of popular music, generally towards a more negative tone. The results show that anger, disgust, fear, sadness, and conscientiousness have increased significantly, while joy, confidence, and openness expressed in pop song lyrics have declined.;"[Napier, Kathleen] Lawrence Technol Univ, Southfield, MI 48075 USA; [Shamir, Lior] Lawrence Technol Univ, Comp Sci, Southfield, MI USA; [Shamir, Lior] Lawrence Technol Univ, Res, Southfield, MI USA";Napier, K (reprint author), Lawrence Technol Univ, Southfield, MI 48075 USA.;;;;;;42;1;1;4;9;UNIV CALIFORNIA PRESS;OAKLAND;155 GRAND AVE, SUITE 400, OAKLAND, CA 94612-3758 USA;1524-2226;1533-1598;;J POP MUSIC STUD;J.

In this context, this article assesses three different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures along with three learning approaches to train them for hieroglyph classification, which is a very challenging task due to the limited availability of segmented ancient Maya glyphs. More precisely, the first approach, the baseline, relies on pretrained networks as feature extractor. The second one investigates a transfer learning method by fine-tuning a pretrained network for our glyph classification task. The third approach considers directly training networks from scratch with our glyph data. The merits of three different network architectures are compared: a generic sequential model (i.e., LeNet), a sketch-specific sequential network (i.e., Sketch-a-Net), and the recent Residual Networks. The sketch-specific model trained from scratch outperforms other models and training strategies. Even for a challenging 150-class classification task, this model achieves 70.3% average accuracy and proves itself promising in case of a small amount of cultural heritage shape data. Furthermore, we visualize the discriminative parts of glyphs with the recent Grad-CAM method, and demonstrate that the discriminative parts learned by the model agree, in general, with the expert annotation of the glyph specificity (diagnostic features). Finally, as a step toward systematic evaluation of these visualizations, we conduct a perceptual crowdsourcing study. Specifically, we analyze the interpretability of the representations from Sketch-a-Net and ResNet-50. Overall, our article takes two important steps toward providing tools to scholars in the digital humanities: increased performance for automation and improved interpretability of algorithms.;"[Can, Gulcan; Odobez, Jean-Marc; Gatica-Perez, Daniel] Idiap Res Inst, Lausanne, Switzerland; [Can, Gulcan; Odobez, Jean-Marc; Gatica-Perez, Daniel] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Elect Engn, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland";"Can, GC (reprint author), Idiap Res Inst, Lausanne, Switzerland.; Can, GC (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Sch Elect Engn, Swiss Fed Inst Technol Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.";;;"Swiss National Science Foundation through the MAAYA project; Hasler Foundation through the DCrowdLens project";This work was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation through the MAAYA project and by the Hasler Foundation through the DCrowdLens project.;;46;1;1;3;8;ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY;NEW YORK;2 PENN PLAZA, STE 701, NEW YORK, NY 10121-0701 USA;1556-4673;1556-4711;;ACM J COMPUT CULT HE;ACM J.

Once upon a time, history of science lived quietly and studious next to the Natural and the Medical Sciences and their wax models, their herbaria, the geological collections, and all the scientific instruments that once had been modern. Suddenly, around 1980, new interests in Philosophy, Sociology and Cultural Studies arose. Provocative research questions as for example the history of rationality, the history of the subaltern technicians in the laboratory, and the ontology and epistemology of the hybrids between nature and culture inspired the intellectual discussions. Although the field flourished, received an abundance of funding and could even build up its own research institutes, after the Millennium, its very existence became gradually jeopardized. Science as we knew it since the Enlightenment lost grounds. The New Economy and not the state anymore provided the funding for research. History of science didn't succeed to survive as expert for data, blind spots, fakes, misinformation, lies, conspiracy theories, and historical thinking in times of scientific accelerations. It began with the loss of reputation, followed by the loss of the job. At the end, history of science lived, not unhappily, ever after as curators of the legacy of Science as we knew it.;[Dommann, Monika] Univ Zurich, Hist Seminar, Karl Schmid Str 4, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland;Dommann, M (reprint author), Univ Zurich, Hist Seminar, Karl Schmid Str 4, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.;;;;;;0;0;0;0;5;WILEY-V C H VERLAG GMBH;WEINHEIM;POSTFACH 101161, 69451 WEINHEIM, GERMANY;0170-6233;1522-2365;;BER WISSGESCH;Ber.

Given a large corpus of images and a query image, an interesting further step is to retrieve the set of original images whose content is present in the query image, as well as the detailed sequences of transformations that yield the query image, given the original images. This is a problem that recently has received the name of image provenance analysis. In these times of public media manipulation (e.g., fake news and meme sharing), obtaining the history of image transformations is relevant for fact checking and authorship verification, among many other applications. This paper presents an end-to-end processing pipeline for image provenance analysis which works at real-world scale. It employs a cutting-edge image filtering solution that is custom-tailored for the problem at hand, as well as novel techniques for obtaining the provenance graph that expresses how the images, as nodes, are ancestrally connected. A comprehensive set of experiments for each stage of the pipeline is provided, comparing the proposed solution with the state-of-the-art results, employing previously published data sets.

The study adopted a qualitative approach using a multiple case study design, within a constructivist paradigm, to respond to the research question, with core competency theory used to provide theoretical support. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions with purposively sampled librarians and postgraduate students from Stellenbosch University, the University of Cape Town and the University of the Western Cape, all of which are situated in the Western Cape of South Africa. A significant finding of the study is that a mixture of discipline-specific knowledge and skills, generic skills and personal attributes are required by humanities librarians to effectively support postgraduate students, especially in the current digital age. The study presents a knowledge and skills framework that could be used to ascertain humanities librarians' current knowledge and skills as well as establish areas for further knowledge and skills acquisition.;"[Johnson, Glynnis] Univ Cape Town Lib, Chancellor Oppenheimer Lib, Private Bag X3 Rondebosch, Cape Town, South Africa; [Raju, Jaya] Univ Cape Town, Lib & Informat Studies Ctr, Cape Town, South Africa";Johnson, G (reprint author), Univ Cape Town Lib, Chancellor Oppenheimer Lib, Private Bag X3 Rondebosch, Cape Town, South Africa.;;;;;;41;0;0;5;15;WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH;BERLIN;GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY;0024-2667;1865-8423;;LIBRI;Libri;DEC;2018;68;4;;;;;331;344;;10.1515/libri-2018-0033;;;14;Information Science & Library Science;Information Science & Library Science;HC4XS;WOS:000451808700005;;;;;07/02/2020

However, the issue of digitization has attracted widespread attention and triggered a debate over how humanities can be democratized through collaboration with digital technologies. The present study offers both an analytical framework of and empirical evidence on the key aspects of digital government engagements in the Indonesian context. This article utilizes a case study approach to examine how digital practices in Jakarta Special Capital Region Province and Surabaya city in Indonesia are attempting to democratize the humanities through efforts to increase access to and participation in the humanities. Both cases will be explored to identify a core set of values such as openness and collaboration of digital democracy practices that unite the digital humanities. This research found that government digitization has changed the way community used to live and interact although the digital divide that is occurred in the research areas has still becoming the major obstacles for government in implementing digital government innovation. Therefore, strong leadership is crucial at the global and local levels to make certain coordinated efforts among governments, local authorities, and other stakeholders on the ground to overcome the digital divide.;[Kusumasari, Bevaola] Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Dept Publ Policy & Management, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia;Kusumasari, B (reprint author), Univ Gadjah Mada, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Dept Publ Policy & Management, Yogyakarta 55281, Indonesia.;;;;;;48;0;0;0;4;RESEARCH CENTER PUBLIC ADM & PUBLIC SERVICE;BUCHAREST;CALEA SERBAN VODA 22-24, BUCHAREST, 040211, ROMANIA;2067-2462;;;MANAG RES PRACT;Manag.

The re-contextualisation of history and memory through a technological gaze implicates us within new forms of vulnerabilities. By reviewing the politics of looking and watching online in digital platforms, the paper invites us to ponder over the flattening of memory and history through algorithms and a digital morality and mortality encoded through user agreements and community standards. The repressing of this moral gaze weaves us into a social media economy where morality and ethics are refashioned through a viral economy where images are circulated, altered and reframed through digital technologies.

There are two ways we can examine spatial distribution and movement in Tang poetry. The first is a static examination of poets' hometowns (jiguan). This method looks at the distribution of poets during a specific period to understand where greater or lesser numbers of poets were born, which places could be considered the center of Tang poetry, and what kinds of geographical changes occurred over time in the Tang literary world. The second is a dynamic examination of poets' activities. When we compare various Tang poets, what differences and changes can we find in the places they lived and traveled? Are the poets' spatial distribution patterns even, or do they favor certain regions? Where were the centers of poetic activity in this period? Were they the same as the political center (the two capitals), or were they located farther out in the provinces? Were they in culturally or politically developed areas or in more remote, less developed ones? In which areas was poetic activity most frequent and intense?

If collected digitally, the anamnesis data can be shared among the health care team. In this article, we introduce a concept for digital anamnesis collection and assess the applicability of a conversational user interface (CUI) for realizing a mobile self-anamnesis application. Materials and Methods We implemented our concept for self-anamnesis for the concrete field of music therapy. We collected requirements with respect to the application from music therapists and by reviewing the literature. A rule-based approach was chosen for realizing the anamnesis conversation between the system and the user. The Artificial Intelligence Markup Language was exploited for encapsulating the questions and responses of the system. For studying the quality of the system and analyzing performance, humanity, effect, and accessibility of the system, we performed a usability test with 22 persons. Results The current version of the self-anamnesis application is equipped with 63 questions on the music biography of a patient that are asked subsequently to the user by means of a chatbot conversation. The usability study showed that a CUI is a practical way for collecting anamnesis data. Users felt engaged of answering the questions and liked the human characteristics of the chatbot. They suggested to extend the conversation capabilities of the chatbot so that the system can react appropriately, in particular when the user is not feeling well. Conclusions We could demonstrate the applicability of a CUI for collecting anamnesis data. In contrast to digital anamnesis questionnaires, the application of a CUI provides several benefits: the user can be encouraged to complete all queries and can ask clarifying questions in case something is unclear.;"[Denecke, Kerstin; May, Richard] Bern Univ Appl Sci, Inst Med Informat, Bern, Switzerland; [Hochreutener, Sandra Lutz] Zurich Univ Arts, Dept Mus, Zurich, Switzerland; [Poepel, Annkathrin] Sanat Kilchberg AG, Ctr Psychosomat, Kilchberg, Switzerland";Denecke, K (reprint author), Bern Univ Appl Sci, Inst Med Informat, Quellgasse 21, CH-2501 Biel, Switzerland.;;Denecke, Kerstin/0000-0001-6691-396X;;;;32;0;0;6;9;GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG;STUTTGART;RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY;0026-1270;2511-705X;;METHOD INFORM MED;Methods Inf.

The increase of the range of open tools, with more functional and user-friendly interfaces, has made possible to identify and visualise previously invisible evidence, synthesise and map temporal information and combine data from heterogeneous sources to generate new data and hypotheses. They have also provided a stimulating setting for raising questions on buildings, cities and territory, as well as the agents interacting with them. The aim of this article is to demonstrate the change, during the process and the practice, of research on history of architecture with the use of digital technologies. To do so, we address a number of issues such as objectivism/subjectivism, data usability, project flexibility, data sustainability and technology training and learning. Finally, after providing an example of how digital technologies can be applied to history of architecture research, we present some strategies, reflections and future lines to be pursued. These point towards the suitability of technologies as new research tools which open possible new pathways for disciplinary collaboration, progress in analytical methods and future reflections on managing the data created.;[Ferreira-Lopes, Patricia] Univ Seville, ETSA, Av Reina Mercedes 2, E-41012 Seville 41012, Spain;Ferreira-Lopes, P (reprint author), Univ Seville, ETSA, Av Reina Mercedes 2, E-41012 Seville 41012, Spain.;Ferreira-Lopes, Patricia/O-1572-2014;Ferreira-Lopes, Patricia/0000-0002-3886-9698;;;;34;0;0;2;4;UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA;BARCELONA;AV TIBIDABO 39-43, BARCELONA, 08035, SPAIN;1695-5951;;;ARTNODES;Artnodes;NOV;2018;;22;;;;;62;71;;10.7238/a.v0i22.3218;;;10;Humanities, Multidisciplinary;Arts & Humanities - Other Topics;HB3FA;WOS:000450934300007;;Bronze;;;07/02/2020

Societies, politics, knowledge, held in Malaga on 18, 19 and 20 October 2017. The conceptual development of the research carried out to construct the installation and to define the spatial and participative characteristics required by its assembly are framed within the context of Digital Humanities as applied to artistic creation. This document shows the creation process for the Cronos system and the manner in which its functionality has been adapted to the specifications required by the Heterochronicity project. Generated by Maria Cuevas Riano and Antonio Labella Martinez (Faculty of Fine Art, Complutense University of Madrid) and Salvador Sancha Ros (CEO, Eneso Tecnologia deAdaptacian), its aim is to reflect on the concept of time-art. In this version of the system, we can observe the presence of time in the reproductive sequence of living organisms (rhythm, duration, behavioural pattern, etc.). This is recorded digitally and reinterpreted on the basis of a musical score, written in line with the authors' criteria, which is used to define the manner in which the public should interact with the proposed installation, so the observer can experience the concept of presence and time. Thanks to the trans-disciplinary work, which has included art theory, artistic production and computer engineering, it has been possible to build a discourse around the visualisation of data-time, to propose an experimental exhibition space and to define the strategies for spectator-user participation. In this article, we share the technical issues and the authors we have referred to in order to prepare our proposed time-art discourse, as well as describing the fundamental aspects of the computational language we have created to produce the installation for the Heterochronicity project.;"[Labella, Antonio; Cuevas, Maria] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Bellas Artes, Pintor Greco,2,Ciudad Univ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Sancha, Salvador] Eneso Tecnol Adaptac SL, C Marie Curie,10 Parque Tecnol Andalucia, Malaga 29590, Spain";Labella, A (reprint author), Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Bellas Artes, Pintor Greco,2,Ciudad Univ, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.;;;;;;10;0;0;0;2;UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA;BARCELONA;AV TIBIDABO 39-43, BARCELONA, 08035, SPAIN;1695-5951;;;ARTNODES;Artnodes;NOV;2018;;22;;;;;72;83;;10.7238/a.v0i22.3233;;;12;Humanities, Multidisciplinary;Arts & Humanities - Other Topics;HB3FA;WOS:000450934300008;;Bronze;;;07/02/2020

Open Access in science or digital editions in the humanities, and data-intensive operations in research, e.g. data management plans, research software support or data curation and preservation services become mission critical. Thus, in order to stay the central partner for academic information within the institution, libraries need to change.

These visualizations produced a stable structure through the 5 decades under analysis, and this structure was analyzed as a data-mined proxy for the disciplinary formation of scientific psychology in the second part of the 20th century. Considering the stable structure uncovered by our term co-occurrence analysis and its visualization, we discuss it in the context of Lee Cronbach's ""Two Disciplines of Scientific Psychology"" (1957) and conventional history of 20th-century psychology's disciplinary formation and history of methods.

Making information available, connecting databases, and making them accessible result in people becoming more and more exposed. Customisation and effectively filtered information sources create filter bubbles. Although new systems of collaboration would be suitable for sharing reliable knowledge, they often lead to the spread of fake news. Despite worrying trends, we seek an encouraging future. Therefore, in this paper we analyse the relationship between information technology, market economy, and the librarian profession from the perspective of Hungarian LIS education, and emphasise the importance of active and creative information provision based on interdisciplinarity. Based on our experiences we believe that current and future readers can be reached through intriguing collages of credible information. The use of collages can compensate for the effects of filter bubbles, and librarians may become the masters of creating digital information collages.;"[Kiszl, Peter; Fodor, Janos] Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Informat Sci, Inst LIS, Budapest, Hungary";Kiszl, P (reprint author), Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Informat Sci, Inst LIS, Budapest, Hungary.;Fodor, Janos/J-5787-2017;Fodor, Janos/0000-0001-7749-7623;;;;90;1;1;5;18;ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC;NEW YORK;360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA;0099-1333;1879-1999;;J ACAD LIBR;J.

GIS can effectively handle spatial entities and offer sophisticated analysis and modelling functions to deal with space. Only a small fraction of the literature in Geographic Information Science-or GIScience in short-has advanced the development of place, addressing entities with an ambiguous boundary and relying more on the human or social attributes of a location rather than on crisp geographic boundaries. While the GIScience developments support the establishment of the digital humanities, GISs were never designed to handle subjective or vague data.

It is the site of vibrant writing in English, Irish, and Latin and of translation from Latin, Spanish, and Italian into English and Irish. While it has received extensive critical attention from historicists, cultural materialists, feminists, and new-British historians over the past three decades, their focus has been the colonial context of the English Renaissance (and writers like Edmund Spenser) rather than the Gaelic and Old English cultures and communities thrown into crisis by the Tudor conquest (ignoring, thereby, writers like, say, Eochaidh & Oacute; hEoghusa or Richard Stanihurst). MACMORRIS is a digital-humanities project designed to correct that lopsided focus by mapping cultural activity across the island in all languages.

What are its methodological innovations, beyond the application of certain technologies? And in what way do they interconnect and hybridize knowledge(s) in an era of widespread prejudice?

This proposal therefore links Iberian Studies with Digital Humanities (or, more specifically, with Digital Spatial Humanities). After some considerations on interactions between (digital) cartography and literary studies, the methodology developed by the Digital map of Iberian literary relations project, with regard to the selection of data and database design, is presented. The final section of the article addresses a number of future problems related to the visualisation of data through maps, suggesting possible solutions based on the experience obtained by other similar projects.;"[Isasi, Santiago Perez] Univ Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal; [Isasi, Santiago Perez] Fac Letras, Alameda Univ, P-1600214 Lisbon, Portugal; [Isasi, Santiago Perez] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Estudios Comparatistas, Fac Letras, Lisbon, Portugal";"Isasi, SP (reprint author), Univ Lisbon, Lisbon, Portugal.; Isasi, SP (reprint author), Fac Letras, Alameda Univ, P-1600214 Lisbon, Portugal.; Isasi, SP (reprint author), Univ Lisbon, Ctr Estudios Comparatistas, Fac Letras, Lisbon, Portugal.";;;;;;24;0;0;0;1;UNIV OBERTA CATALUNYA;BARCELONA;AV TIBIDABO 39-43, BARCELONA, 08035, SPAIN;1695-5951;;;ARTNODES;Artnodes;NOV;2018;;22;;;;;92;100;;;;;9;Humanities, Multidisciplinary;Arts & Humanities - Other Topics;HB3FA;WOS:000450934300010;;;;;07/02/2020

By adopting this mono-disciplinary approach, relevant aspects to other fields of research, and even to linguistic study itself, are disregarded: original spelling, manuscript physical description or socio-historical context. Taking this into account, the historical and epistolary corpus of Post Scriptum takes a multi-disciplinary approach involving linguists and historians, and combining methods from digital humanities and corpus linguistics.

Methods The study examined 10 cases of U.K.-based research, two from each of the following social science and humanities disciplines: business/management, education, history, literature, and politics. Data collection employed a qualitative methodology that consisted of nonparticipant observation and semi-structured interviews. Results The article finds that researchers problematize the meaning and top-down character of interdisciplinarity and envisage the development of research communities of experience exchange and knowledge sharing that go beyond the imperative of interdisciplinarity. Conclusion The article challenges prevalent assumptions that digital research and interdisciplinarity go hand in hand and that one is a prerequisite for and in need of the other, while it invites institutional and funding bodies to consider working jointly with researchers toward developing the alternative of research communities of practice.;"[Zhao, Yupei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Tsatsou, Panayiota] Univ Leicester, Leicester, Leics, England";Tsatsou, P (reprint author), Univ Leicester, Sch Media Commun & Sociol, 132 New Walk, Leicester LE1 7JA, Leics, England.;Tsatsou, Panayiota/I-1883-2013;Tsatsou, Panayiota/0000-0001-6670-4711;EPSRC Community and Culture Network+ award [RS15G0111];This work was supported by an EPSRC Community and Culture Network+ award (RS15G0111).

Its widespread use stands in sharp contrast to the paucity of its theoretical development, which is limited to Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's 1975 seminal book Kafka. Pour une litterature mineure. We claim that a comparative history of minor literatures in European languages - a nonexistent project so far - requires three preliminary steps, namely, conceptual clarification, cross-pollination between comparative literary history and the digital humanities, and a bibliometric analysis of the minor-literature constellation. First, conceptual clarification is needed to show, on the one hand, how Deleuze and Guattari's arguments on minor literatures significantly differ from those of what they posit as their source (Kafka's discussion on kleine Literaturen) and, on the other hand, the existence of alternative genealogies. Second, by adhering to a Braudelian definition of comparative history, the massive data needed for addressing the production and reception of (minor) literatures in specific social and cultural contexts would immensely benefit from recourse to digital tools. Third, and as an example of approaching conceptual clarification with digital tools, a quantitative study of the minorliterature constellation must be performed using a key tool of international scholarship (the MLA International Bibliography). In the current paper, we may only provide an introductory survey of these three fields and, therefore, the results are tentative and further research is needed.;"[Dominguez, Cesar] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Philol, Burgo Nat S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain; [Di Rosario, Giovanna; Ciastellardi, Matteo] Politecn Milan, Dept Design, Bldg 67,Via Durando 38-A, I-20158 Milan, Italy";Dominguez, C (reprint author), Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Philol, Burgo Nat S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain.;;;;;;67;0;0;1;7;WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH;BERLIN;GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY;0003-7982;1613-0642;;ARCADIA;Arcadia;NOV;2018;53;2;;;;;278;307;;10.1515/arcadia-2018-0028;;;30;Literature;Literature;GZ4DA;WOS:000449341900005;;;;;07/02/2020

However, the conditions of abundant data typical of digital humanities tend to relax the constraints of tests of significance and to allow greater freedom to try out alternative interpretations within the frame of a single study. At the same time, the elusiveness of rigorous standardization within a very large database, especially if it stretches over wide spaces or many decades, may be seen to demand meticulous source criticism of a sort that has more often been associated with the humanities than with quantitative science. There is even a tendency for the data itself to drift away from its usual function as a means of research and to become itself an object of study, inspiring reflection on how the tools and concepts of a field like psychology may be evolving in response to new constraints or ambitions.;[Porter, Theodore M.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA;Porter, TM (reprint author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Hist, Box 951473,6265 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.;;;;;;11;1;1;3;4;EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC;WASHINGTON;750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA;1093-4510;1939-0610;;HIST PSYCHOL;Hist.

The two can work complementarily-so closely, in fact, that it sometimes becomes difficult to know which of the two one is practicing at any given moment.

Each of the commentators approached the topic through their own lens-Melinda Baldwin as a historian of scientific journals, Christopher Green as a pioneer in digital history of psychology, and Ted Porter as a historian of quantification. In my response, I tried to reply to the 3 comments by critically discussing 4 themes the special section has raised: the relationship between digital history and conventional history, the perspective that takes databases as both sources for historians and objects in history, the relationship between ""thick descriptions"" and ""thin"" digital ones, and finally, the role of digital history as a type of a ""trading creole"" between scientists working in quantified disciplines like scientific psychology and less quantified ones like history. I think the commentators have rightly observed some pitfalls in the uncritical application of digital history. On the other hand, in my response, I argue that the careful use of digital methods, where the user stays in communication with nondigital historians, opens new perspectives for historians of science, historians of psychology, and psychologists themselves.

Dianetics was the brainchild of science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard, and became the foundation for scientology toward the end of the decade. Dianetics was marketed as a ""scientific"" method for mental improvement-a robust alternative to conventional psychiatry-and was strongly debated in science fiction (sf) magazines. This article follows the trajectory of this cultural phenomenon from 1949 to 1999 as it appeared in this form of popular culture. A proximal reading method was applied to analyze 4,431 magazines, and identified 389 references to dianetics and scientology. References were found in advertising, reader letters, stories, feature articles, and editorials. Significant fluctuations in the prominence and perception of dianetics became clearly visible in the source material across a broad spectrum of content. Negative criticism was present from the outset, and based on logical and scientific arguments. This was countered by obfuscation, or attacks on the authors of these critiques.

Each of these methodologies are deeply rooted in visual imagery and while they may share different levels of similarities, each was coined because no existing method fully met the needs of the researchers or participants. For this same reason, a new image-based methodology, the Fotofeedback Method (TM) (FFM) has emerged. FFM is defined as a qualitative image-based methodology that combines participant-initiated photography with written narrative in response to a research/evaluation inquiry. This article presents an overview of FFM's formation along with examples of its use and subsequent outcomes. The aforementioned image-based methodologies are reviewed including their definition, founder, year conceptualised, discipline and location of origin, brief history, impact of use, key point and their similarities/differences to the FFM. Also presented is a comparison chart of the methodologies covered in this paper as well as a timeline of photo-based research techniques in relation to the historical development of photography, computers and social media.

From 38 articles studied, a variety of research methods were represented. Analysis showed Professional and Applied Sciences were overwhelmingly represented with the majority of articles within the discipline of Education and its fields with Humanities a distant second category of publication.

Our analysis draws on a corpus of over a thousand letters from the North American Letter Collection held at the Forschungsbibliothek Gotha in Germany. Through computer-assisted text analysis, framed by research on transnationalism and immigrant integration, we explore patterns in integration and identities over time. We show how the migrants continuously redefine their identities vis-a-vis their homeland and the host society, and their letters thereby shape the image of the United States and the homeland for their recipients. Our analysis establishes more comprehensively than have previous historical and social science studies that integration into a host society is a non-linear process. Immigrant identities are influenced less by the time they have spent in the receiving country than by critical political events that affect both the country of origin and that of destination. Such events can reactivate migrant's identifications with their homeland. Immigrant networks filter this dual process in that they can facilitate migrants' integration while also reminding them of people and places left behind.";"[Krawatzek, Felix; Sasse, Gwendolyn] Univ Oxford, Dept Polit, Oxford, England; [Krawatzek, Felix; Sasse, Gwendolyn] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England";"Krawatzek, F (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Dept Polit, Oxford, England.; Krawatzek, F (reprint author), Univ Oxford, Nuffield Coll, Oxford, England.";;"Krawatzek, Felix/0000-0002-1108-6087; Sasse, Gwendolyn/0000-0001-6254-3949";"Large Leverhulme Trust Grant ""Political Remittances: Understanding the Political Impacts of Migration"" [M3RVQL00]; Small Award from the John Fell Fund/Oxford University Press Research Fund [143/003]";"The authors are grateful for research assistance provided by Christian Fastenrath.

However, that renaming is problematic as it emphasises the research tools used while the field itself is adjusting to include new methods, new topics, and new types of production, not just new ways of working with existing materials. Historians have long been alert to new tools as they become available to researchers. However, even as historians have revelled in the increased access to primary sources provided by digitisation and have analysed the opportunities that access offers, they have been aware of the unevenness of the digitisation process and the gaps it both creates and disguises. Issues of copyright and the ethics of creating public access to private lives have also caused historians concern. More recently, discussion about the evaluation of digital scholarship has begun. Often purely digital outputs are not formally recognised by their authors' institutions, despite having a significant online presence and contributing to scholarship. In parallel with being concerned about fairly assessing the work of peers, historians have also begun to consider how to teach (and assess) the digital skills now expected of history graduates.;[Brennan, Claire] James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia;Brennan, C (reprint author), James Cook Univ, Townsville, Qld, Australia.;Brennan, Claire/G-4393-2016;Brennan, Claire/0000-0002-7593-7522;;;;59;0;0;3;20;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1478-0542;;;HISTORY COMPASS;History Compass;OCT;2018;16;10;;;;;;;e12492;10.1111/hic3.12492;;;12;History;History;GW3TR;WOS:000446831400009;;;;;07/02/2020

Drawing on a customised corpus of writing about the English Lake District, we model the application of a multiscalar approach known as geographical text analysis (GTA), which combines aspects of close reading and distant reading, and, in doing so, introduces a new method for literary research. Here, we focus on historical descriptions of the Lake District's soundscape to demonstrate both how perceptions of sound changed over the course of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and how multi-scalar methods can uniquely uncover such historical-literary shifts. Sound, we argue, offers a particularly useful focus since it allows us to draw fruitful parallels between our methods and those applied by the writers we study. In this way, this article advocates for digital humanities scholarship that advances our disciplines in conversation with appropriate historical modes.;"[Taylor, Joanna E.] Univ Manchester, Digital Humanities, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Gregory, Ian N.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Hist, Digital Humanities, Lancaster, England; [Donaldson, Christopher] Univ Lancaster, Cultural Hist, Lancaster, England";Taylor, JE (reprint author), Univ Manchester, Digital Humanities, Manchester, Lancs, England.;;"Donaldson, Christopher/0000-0002-2924-3001; Gregory, Ian/0000-0001-8745-2242; Taylor, Joanna Elizabeth/0000-0001-8597-0097";Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust [RPG-2015-230];Research for this article was carried out as part of the project Geospatial Innovations in the Digital Humanities: A Deep Map of the English Lake District, funded by the Leverhulme Trust (RPG-2015-230).

This network interaction has allowed creating a special space for joint activity, allowing participants to build a trajectory of their own spiritual and moral development, which is considered by the authors as a complex of personal search and experience of participants. The innovative components of such a cooperation are the educational institutions united by Kalmyk State University. The calendar of activities for all the participants of the network and the content of the network cooperation are located at www.schoolnano.ru. The systemically important center for this cooperation at the regional level is the Kalmyk State University named after B. B.

In recent years, its evolution has been witnessed foremost in the growth of funded DH projects and through the willingness of scholars from diverse backgrounds to not only work in DH research, but also as 'digital humanists'. One crucial component to DH research is that of spatial enquiry, the expansion of which has rapidly evolved from a small component often found buried in research objectives, to the research aim of a growing number of projects. Spatial humanities, while still a relatively new interdisciplinary field, is exhibiting continued advancement and focus from the academic community; however, working with digital data is rarely a straightforward pursuit, even for the most accomplished scholar. Primarily access to appropriate and reliable (spatial) datasets, the keystone of spatial humanities research, the sharing and openness of spatial methods, tools and data (SMTD), and education in the former, all remain a challenge. Witnessing the continued rise of spatial humanities research, this special issue brings together a selection of articles delivered at Spatial Humanities 2016, a conference held at Lancaster University (UK). The aim of this multi-disciplinary conference was to explore and demonstrate the contribution to knowledge that spatial technologies in humanities research may enable within and beyond the digital humanities. Here, this introductory text and associated articles present key research that embodies the growing relevance of the spatial humanities across a plethora of fields and demonstrates several of the prevailing and enduring struggles when working in digital and spatial research.

J;Gulum, E;;;;Gulum, Erol;;;Virtual Enviroment as a Digital Communication Technologies-Mediated Folkloric Experience Sphere;MILLI FOLKLOR;;;Turkish;Article;;;;;;"Folklore; internet; digital folklore; mediated cultural enviroment; digital humanities";;It is observed that virtual environment as a shared techno-social life space which is momently being reproduced through the convergence between digital communication technologies that work as relationship enabler in everyday use and Web 2.0 based interaction applications have turn into a efficient channel for the production, transmission and consumption of folklore besides expanding the performance scope of various offline cultural practices and activities. Especially, when the necessary condition of folklore is fixed the motive of human, the need of expressing oneself and creativity instead of face to face interactions, it becomes more evident that the virtual environment is a factor that can provide the sufficient condition for folkloric production. When dealt with in this context, it could be claimed that domesticated virtual environment in which or on which socio-cultural activities can be performed have evolved a new folkloric experience domain that makes possible the emergence of original and even authentic folkloric performances and productions. The aspects of this situation that directly interest folklore studies are that communication and interaction technologies in generally and Internet in particular anymore have become a main factor of folkloric production and that many new, creative and hybrid cultural expressions which have some folkloric qualities have emerged in the generated virtual contexts. Here, in this study which problematized whether virtual environment is appropriate for cultural production in general and folkloric production in particular will be discussed the folklorization of virtual environment rather than virtualization of folklore according to specified parametres. Hence, it will be tried to reveal how cultural environment and contexts that are generated through digital communication technology have turn into an area of experience which is almost equivalent to oral environment over time.;[Gulum, Erol] Bilecik Seyh Edebali Univ, Fen Edebiyat Fak, Turk Dili & Edebiyati Bolumu, Bilecik, Turkey;Gulum, E (reprint author), Bilecik Seyh Edebali Univ, Fen Edebiyat Fak, Turk Dili & Edebiyati Bolumu, Bilecik, Turkey.;;;;;;20;0;0;2;2;MILLI FOLKLOR DERGISI;ANKARA;PK 336, ANKARA, YENISEHR 06420, TURKEY;1300-3984;;;MILLI FOLKLOR;Milli Folklor;FAL;2018;;119;;;;;127;139;;;;;13;Folklore;Arts & Humanities - Other Topics;HB8RN;WOS:000451358400010;;;;;07/02/2020

However, the mechanisms by which the Internet facilitates self-radicalization are disputed; some fault the individuals who end up self-radicalized, while others lay the blame on the technology itself. In this paper, we explore the role played by technological design decisions in online self-radicalization in its myriad guises, encompassing extreme as well as more mundane forms. We begin by characterizing the phenomenon of technological seduction. Next, we distinguish between top-down seduction and bottom-up seduction. We then situate both forms of technological seduction within the theoretical model of dynamical systems theory. We conclude by articulating strategies for combating online self-radicalization.";"[Alfano, Mark] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands; [Alfano, Mark] Australian Catholic Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Carter, J.

Our collaborative projects drive forward the research agendas of both humanists and technologists. There have been other changes too. The focus of our scholarly interest has moved away from its historical origins in text-based scholarship, although that now has many more possibilities, and we are seeing an interest in exploring culture and heritage more widely. Where the progress is slower is in our moves towards openness and inclusivity, and this is to some extent hampered by a lack of linguistic diversity. This is being addressed with specialist groups within the major DH organizations on a national and a global level. DH has grown rapidly in China, and the anglophone world could do more to engage with practitioners and potential colleagues in this new vibrant and emerging area. There are certainly Western centres that specialize, particularly in Chinese texts and historical documents, but this needs to be extended further if we are not to impose limits on the conversations, synergies and collaborations that can result.";[Mahony, Simon] UCL, UCL Ctr Digital Humanities, Dept Informat Studies, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England;Mahony, S (reprint author), UCL, UCL Ctr Digital Humanities, Dept Informat Studies, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.;;Mahony, Simon/0000-0001-9811-9381;;;;19;0;0;2;9;SPRINGER HEIDELBERG;HEIDELBERG;TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY;1674-0750;2198-2600;;FUDAN J HUM SOC SCI;Fudan J.

This essay focuses on arguably the most controversial: the use of statistical methodologies to analyze literary texts. Often aimed at the ""distant reading"" practices of Franco Moretti, the pros and cons of these methods have been widely debated among literary scholars, but with little reference to their historical roots. Historical accounts of DH have instead focused on technological developments, citing the massive, computerized concordance of the works of Thomas Aquinas, envisioned in 1949 by Father Roberto Busa and realized by IBM over the next 20years, as the moment DH was born. Such accounts, as useful as they are, neglect important connections between the computational methodologies of DH and the emergence of modern statistical methodology during the nineteenth century. The advantage of seeing DH as part of the history of statistics is that it helps us understand and evaluate statistically based DH methodologies in their own terms and not simply as methodologies associated with particular neoliberal institutions in the present. This essay argues that understanding the history of statistics as well as examining current practice helps address the criticisms leveled at computational methodologies and the question of compatibility with traditional humanistic methodologies such as close reading. It begins with a brief history of the emergence of modern statistics in the nineteenth century and the impact on Victorian literature and popular culture and then examines recent DH scholarship that utilizes statistical methodologies to analyze Victorian texts.";[Babb, Genie] SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, English, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA;Babb, G (reprint author), SUNY Coll Plattsburgh, Plattsburgh, NY 12901 USA.;;;;;;68;0;0;0;5;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1741-4113;;;LIT COMPASS;Lit.

J;Candel, D;;;;Candel, Daniel;;;A report on the reports of the stanford literary lab: A reason why the digital humanities may find it difficult to change literary history;SEMIOTICA;;;English;Article;;;;;;"digital humanities; literary history; literary semantics; modal logic";;The present article studies eight of the twelve reports of the Stanford Literary Lab (SLL) to understand why the revolutionary practices of the lab, and by extension of the digital humanities, have not yet changed literary history, as the lab itself admits. The article examines the reports with two related culturalsemantic tools, each of which is introduced via the Pixar movie Brave. First, the interpretations of the reports are placed within a basic semantic grid organized into four quadrants by a nature-society axis and a past-present axis, which shows that the interpretations are invariably situated in the present-society quadrant. This analysis, while necessary, merely proves that SLL operates within a certain cultural climate. The real test lies in ascertaining whether this cultural climate affects the interpretation of novel data. To do so, the article looks for the reaction of SLL to novel data in two reports. The reports are shown to domesticate novelty by explaining it through standard alethic/deontic patterns, even though the data are novel precisely because the patterns largely fail to explain them. The article closes by asking whether such patterns limit or enable thinking and what this means for the digital humanities.;[Candel, Daniel] Univ Alcala De Henares, Modern Languages, Alcala De Henares, Spain;Candel, D (reprint author), Univ Alcala De Henares, Modern Languages, Alcala De Henares, Spain.;;;;;;54;0;0;4;13;WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH;BERLIN;GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY;0037-1998;1613-3692;;SEMIOTICA;Semiotica;SEP;2018;;224;;;;;111;134;;10.1515/sem-2016-0223;;;24;"Humanities, Multidisciplinary; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary";"Arts & Humanities - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics";GS1DN;WOS:000443255800005;;;;;07/02/2020

As a result, heritage discovery and conservation remain a huge challenge for both developed and developing countries, with heritage sites often inadequately cared for, be it due to a lack of resources, nonrecognition of the value by local people or authorities, human conflict, or some other reason. This paper presents an online geo-crowdsourcing system, termed Share Our Cultural Heritage (SOCH), which can be utilized for large-scale heritage documentation and sharing. Supported by web and mobile GIS, cultural heritage data such as textual stories, locations, and images can be acquired via portable devices. These data are georeferenced and presented to the public via web-mapping. Using photogrammetric modelling, acquired images are used to reconstruct heritage structures or artefacts into 3D digital models, which are then visualized on the SOCH web interface to enable public interaction. This end-to-end system incubates an online virtual community to encourage public engagement, raise awareness, and stimulate cultural heritage ownership. It also provides valuable resources for cultural heritage exploitation, management, education, and monitoring over time.;"[Dhonju, Hari K.] Pathway Technol & Serv Pvt Ltd, Kathmandu 44600, Nepal; [Xiao, Wen; Mills, Jon P.; Sarhosis, Vasilis] Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England";Xiao, W (reprint author), Newcastle Univ, Sch Engn, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.;Mills, Jon/H-7444-2013;"Mills, Jon/0000-0001-5304-7935; Sarhosis, Vasilis/0000-0003-4495-9902; Xiao, Wen/0000-0003-4922-8228; Sarhosis, Vasileios/0000-0002-5748-7679";Newcastle University's 'GCRF Preparing Award' - UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [BH162837];This research is supported by Newcastle University's 'GCRF Preparing Award' (BH162837) funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).;;45;0;0;5;18;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2220-9964;;;ISPRS INT J GEO-INF;ISPRS Int.

J;Pawlik, L;;;;Pawlik, Lucas;;;Forget the Adults. Parkland School Shooting: Running Amok in a Society Without Perspective;PADIATRIE UND PADOLOGIE;;;German;Article;;;;;;"Parkland; School Shooting; Digitalization; Communal Intelligence; Future of Education";;"This essay consists of three parts, in which the individual experience of a school massacre is related to its social reactions viewed in the context of humanity's digital transformation. This first part shows how paralysis, anger, lack of trust on the part of the victims, and their imprisonment in uncertainty about the present and future influence the reactions of the media and those in positions of responsibility. Individual disintegration and the imminent collapse of the system point to the same overload: denial of an unbearable, incalculable situation. This is a problem for which the school system cannot take responsibility, nor is it being taken care of externally. The second part of the essay explores how the search for an ""insane lone perpetrator"", who is recognised and has to be denied access to guns, is actually a product of the system. This system ignores both the actual circumstances of how someone becomes a school shooter and the significant study on school shootings published in 2004. According to this study, school shooters are mostly suicidal and bullied students who want to achieve more than they are able to accomplish and announce their deed in their despair. The multi-causal context of how a student becomes a frenzied school shooter remains ignored. Instead of an analysis of the prevailing educational and social system, the fiction of an insane lone perpetrator is maintained, perpetuating the problem of school shooters until the next killing spree. The third part addresses the question why this problem is relevant to Austria too. It outlines the critical situation of the global education system and schoolchildren, and examines why a further drastic deterioration brought about by digitalization is to be expected. The necessity of self-initiative and the steps with which the author asks for help in being able to solve the growing problems and open up new possibilities are shown.";;;;;;;;0;0;0;2;15;SPRINGER WIEN;WIEN;SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA;0030-9338;1613-7558;;PADIATR PADOL;Padiatr.

The humanities have largely remained outside of this shift, despite their increasing reliance on digital means for information seeking. Given that publications in the humanities have a longer than average life-span, mainly due to the importance of monographs for the field, this article proposes to use domain-specific reference monographs to bootstrap the enrichment of library catalogs with citation data. Reference monographs are works considered to be of particular importance in a research library setting, and likely to possess characteristic citation patterns. The article shows how to select a corpus of reference monographs, and proposes a pipeline to extract the network of publications they refer to. Results using a set of reference monographs in the domain of the history of Venice show that only 7% of extracted citations are made to publications already within the initial seed. Furthermore, the resulting citation network suggests the presence of a core set of works in the domain, cited more frequently than average.;"[Colavizza, Giovanni; Romanello, Matteo; Kaplan, Frederic] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Digital Humanities Lab, Stn 14, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland";Colavizza, G (reprint author), Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Digital Humanities Lab, Stn 14, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.;;"Colavizza, Giovanni/0000-0002-9806-084X; Romanello, Matteo/0000-0002-7406-6286";"Swiss National Fund under Division II [205121_159961]; Swiss National FundSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) [P1ELP2_168489]";We thank Martina Babetto and Silvia Ferronato for the digitization and annotation of the dataset.

J;"Ping, Q; Chen, CM";;;;"Ping, Qing; Chen, Chaomei";;;LitStoryTeller plus : an interactive system for multi-level scientific paper visual storytelling with a supportive text mining toolbox;SCIENTOMETRICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Visual storytelling; Narrative storylines; Close-reading; Scientific paper visualization; Extractive summarization; Comparative sentence classification";;The continuing growth of scientific publications has posed a double-challenge to researchers, to not only grasp the overall research trends in a scientific domain, but also get down to research details embedded in a collection of core papers. Existing work on science mapping provides multiple tools to visualize research trends in domain on macro-level, and work from the digital humanities have proposed text visualization of documents, topics, sentences, and words on micro-level. However, existing micro-level text visualizations are not tailored for scientific paper corpus, and cannot support meso-level scientific reading, which aligns a set of core papers based on their research progress, before drilling down to individual papers. To bridge this gap, the present paper proposes LitStoryTeller+, an interactive system under a unified framework that can support both meso-level and micro-level scientific paper visual storytelling. More specifically, we use entities (concepts and terminologies) as basic visual elements, and visualize entity storylines across papers and within a paper borrowing metaphors from screen play. To identify entities and entity communities, named entity recognition and community detection are performed. We also employ a variety of text mining methods such as extractive text summarization and comparative sentence classification to provide rich textual information supplementary to our visualizations. We also propose a top-down story-reading strategy that best takes advantage of our system. Two comprehensive hypothetical walkthroughs to explore documents from the computer science domain and history domain with our system demonstrate the effectiveness of our story-reading strategy and the usefulness of LitStoryTeller+.;"[Ping, Qing; Chen, Chaomei] Drexel Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA";Ping, Q (reprint author), Drexel Univ, Coll Comp & Informat, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Chen, Chaomei/A-1252-2007;"Chen, Chaomei/0000-0001-8584-1041; PING, QING/0000-0002-8919-9364";"project ""A Visual Analytic Observatory of Scientific Knowledge"" - National Science Foundation [NSF 1633286]";"This study is supported by the project ""A Visual Analytic Observatory of Scientific Knowledge"" funded by National Science Foundation (NSF 1633286).";;44;1;1;7;27;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;0138-9130;1588-2861;;SCIENTOMETRICS;Scientometrics;SEP;2018;116;3;;;;;1887;1944;;10.1007/s11192-018-2803-x;;;58;"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Information Science & Library Science";"Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science";GQ8LT;WOS:000442007200024;;;;;07/02/2020

Humanists are well aware that cultural knowledge, aesthetic value and copyright/ownership are not monolithic, yet digital humanities work often expects the replication of narrow ideas of such. Drawing on the growing body of scholarship that situates the digital humanities in a broad global context, this paper points to areas of tension within the field and posits ways that digital humanities practitioners might resist such moves to homogenize the field. Working within the framework of border studies, the paper considers how working across national barriers might further digital humanities work. Finally, ideas of ownership and/or copyright are unique to country of origin and, as such, deserve careful attention.

Communication practices of micromorphological researchers have not evolved significantly or, at least, at the same rate as archaeology as a whole, which has recently experienced an explosion of technological applications related to documentation. This paper aims to explore and illustrate a new methodological proposal for thin section digitalization and for the presentation of micromorphological data in scientific articles. We started from a premise: micromorphology should be a discipline based on images, since they provide the essential data of micromorphological observation and inference. The proposal combines existing tools and techniques, as well as those from other disciplines, to increase the standard quality of images used in scientific publications and produce dynamic and contextualized illustrations of research results in micromorphology. The final goal of the workflow is to provide keys and tools that allow researchers, as producers of information, to present their data in a more effective, contextualized and informative way as article enrichments or linked illustrations in their papers. To illustrate the procedure, we use two samples from different archaeological contexts: the Palaeolithic site of Roc de Marsal (France) and the Roman city of Baelo Claudia (Spain). The benefits of this proposal are multiple: a) access and objectivity to raw research data, b) improvement in the interaction among micromorphologists, c) spreading of the informative potential of micromorphology to the research community, and, finally, d) making the reader an active participant in the information. Although there are different eligible ways of image scanning and data sharing, the combination of gigapixel thin sections and article enrichments define a step forward in communicating research results and sharing raw data, an opportunity that should be fostered and not be missed.;"[Gutierrez-Rodriguez, Mario; Goldberg, Paul] Univ Granada, Prehist & Archaeol Dept, Campus Univ Cartuja CP, Granada 18011, Spain; [Toscano, Maurizio] Univ Granada, Dept Medieval Hist & Hist Sci & Tech, Campus Univ Cartuja CP, Granada 18011, Spain; [Goldberg, Paul] Univ Wollongong, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia; [Goldberg, Paul] Eberhard Karls Univ Tiibingen, Inst Archaeol Sci, Tubingen, Germany";Gutierrez-Rodriguez, M (reprint author), Univ Granada, Prehist & Archaeol Dept, Campus Univ Cartuja CP, Granada 18011, Spain.;"Gutierrez-Rodriguez, Mario/AAA-9002-2020; Toscano, Maurizio/AAA-2421-2019";"Gutierrez-Rodriguez, Mario/0000-0003-2045-1493; Toscano, Maurizio/0000-0001-5418-3859";"Campus de Excelencia Internacional en Patrimonio of University of Jaen [125]; University of Granada [197]; Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports of Spain provided a Formacion del Profesorado Universitario [FPU13/02363]";"Authors wish to acknowledge the financial support provided by institutions involved in this research.

J;Wright, SH;;;;Wright, Sharon Hubbs;;;Medieval English peasant women and their historians: A historiography with a future?;HISTORY COMPASS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"14TH-CENTURY ENGLAND; VILLAGE; GENDER; POWER; WORK";Scholarship concerning medieval peasant women grew out of economic, Marxist, legal, and social history and, since the late 1970s, has been taken up mainly by medieval scholars using feminist methodologies. This research has been conducted by a handful of scholars most actively working before 2000. A large portion of this research has been focused on recovering information about peasant women's daily lives, their occupations, and their remuneration for work. From this body of research, scholars have attempted to understand and demonstrate the social and cultural conditions which affected peasant women's status and their agency. While most agree that peasant women's lives were profoundly affected by gendered ideas, there has been debate about the degree to which patriarchal institutions and beliefs have limited women's lives. This article focuses on scholarship concerning peasant women situated in their own social milieu, rather than their representation in art and literature. It argues that there remain many opportunities for further research, especially in the form of team-based research, which is becoming more common in digital humanities.;[Wright, Sharon Hubbs] Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Medieval Hist, Saskatoon, SK, Canada;Wright, SH (reprint author), Univ Saskatchewan, St Thomas More Coll, Saskatoon, SK, Canada.;;Wright, Sharon/0000-0002-4196-9796;;;;63;0;0;1;7;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;1478-0542;;;HISTORY COMPASS;History Compass;AUG;2018;16;8;;;;;;;e12461;10.1111/hic3.12461;;;11;History;History;GP4IK;WOS:000440824500002;;;;;07/02/2020

So, why not humanity? Building automatic factories, digital modelling of human work, both makes realistic what looked utopian. It can perhaps be achieved an unmanned production mode, and where machines can produce whatever we can desire, endlessly. Are numbers not from zero to infinity? There is, nonetheless, an obstacle. Human desires are subjective; therefore, from the standpoint of the producers, of the automatic factory's owner, there is a very difficult problem to go through. How to manage human desires? How to transform the desire itself in an automatic factor of the production? Digital modelling of human work is not enough; the human itself must be modelled. The full control of him/her must be achieved. It means understanding a priori each of his/her desire. It means leading him/her step by step all their lives long.

In this perspective, 'digital collections', 'digital libraries', etc. are in fact hybrid collections, or libraries. For musical artefacts, the range of historical media is especially complex, which again concerns the digital world. Digital Humanities publications also contribute to the complex and confusing situation as they themselves are not only 'information', but as a rule, complex and hybrid textual systems that often contain complete digitized re-publications of cultural objects, providing them with digital 'inscriptions', and interlinking them. So the hybridity of 'digital libraries' increases as soon as Digital Humanities publications are integrated.

These data sets often contain indirect spatial information, such as historical addresses. Historical geocoding is the process of transforming indirect spatial information into direct locations which can be placed on a map, thus allowing for spatial analysis and cross-referencing. There are many geocoders that work efficiently for current addresses. However, these do not tackle temporal information, and usually follow a strict hierarchy (country, city, street, house number, etc.) which is difficult-if not impossible-to use with historical data. Historical data is filled with uncertainty (pertaining to temporal, textual, and positional accuracy, as well as to the reliability of historical sources) which can neither be ignored nor entirely resolved. Our open source, open data, and extensible solution for geocoding is based on extracting a large number of simple gazetteers composed of geohistorical objects, from historical maps. Geocoding a historical address becomes the process of finding one or several geohistorical objects in the gazetteers which best match the historical address searched by the user. The matching criteria are customisable, weighted, and include several dimensions (fuzzy string, fuzzy temporal, level of detail, positional accuracy). Since our goal is to facilitate historical work, we also put forward web-based user interfaces which help geocode (one address or batch mode) and display results over current or historical maps. Geocoded results can then be checked and edited collaboratively (no source is modified). The system was tested on the city of Paris, France, for the 19th and 20th centuries. It showed high response rates and worked quickly enough to be used interactively.;"[Cura, Remi; Abadie, Nathalie; Costes, Benoit; Perret, Julien] Univ Paris Est, Inst Natl Informat Geog & Forestiere IGN, LaSTIG ENSG, F-94165 St Mande, France; [Cura, Remi; Dumenieu, Bertrand; Perret, Julien; Gribaudi, Maurizio] GeoHistoricalData, Paris, France; [Dumenieu, Bertrand; Perret, Julien; Gribaudi, Maurizio] EHESS, F-75006 Paris, France";"Perret, J (reprint author), Univ Paris Est, Inst Natl Informat Geog & Forestiere IGN, LaSTIG ENSG, F-94165 St Mande, France.; Perret, J (reprint author), GeoHistoricalData, Paris, France.; Perret, J (reprint author), EHESS, F-75006 Paris, France.";"Perret, Julien/N-9058-2019; Perret, Julien/J-9017-2015";"Perret, Julien/0000-0002-0685-0730; Perret, Julien/0000-0002-0685-0730; Dumenieu, Bertrand/0000-0002-2517-2058";Belle Epoque project - PSL (The Parisian Financiers' Belle Epoque (1871-1913).

'Edgy Romanticism', inspired by a conference held in April 2016 at Edge Hill University, looks again at these figures, but we are also interested in new work that is being done at the edges of the discipline, thinking about new methodologies and themes as constituting the borders and boundaries of Romanticism as such. So, our collection of articles begins and ends with new ways to conceptualise Romantic understandings of history, continuing with novel approaches to place, canonical Romantic poetry, and women's writing.

J;Gleissner, P;;;;Gleissner, Philip;;;Soviet Union on the Seine: Kontinent, Sintaksis, and the Social Life of Emigre Journals;RUSSIAN REVIEW;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;This article examines the ways in which literary journals organized the intellectual life and literary culture of the so-called third-wave emigration in the 1970s and 1980s. It focuses on the two periodicals Kontinent and Sintaksis (founded in 1974 and 1978, respectively)-not merely through the lens of individual contributions or statements by editors, such as Vladimir Maximov, Maria Rozanova, and Andrey Sinyavsky. Applying new methodological approaches from the emerging field of periodical studies and digital humanities, this article argues that through these journals, the third wave creates in the West a cultural environment that resembles the Soviet one on a structural level. The disagreement between individual emigre periodicals, like the two discussed here, is not simply an ideological conflict-be it between Soviet socialism and dissidence or along one of the cleavage lines that divided the emigre community. The model of the literary-artistic and sociopolitical journal, now transplanted to the West in the form of Maximov's Kontinent, comes to functionally mimic the Soviet mass publication, absorbing and masking dissent without the need for active censorship. Established successfully in the mid-1970s, this model prompts a number of subversive tactics expressed in Rozanova's editorial work. Relying on a cultural repertoire rooted in Soviet experience, Sintaksis becomes a constitutive element of the Soviet Union on the Seine, a cultural space that understands itself in opposition to and ideologically divorced from the Soviet Union, without, however, becoming fully independent from it.;;;;;;;;42;0;0;0;1;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0036-0341;1467-9434;;RUSS REV;Russ.

It is characterised by the pervasive implementation of convergent technologies, the shift in forms of ownership, fusion of cyber-physical and social realities, endowment of machines with elements of intellect and utilisation of social media in new communication alternatives. Such major social shifts will inevitably instigate a search for new methods of interaction between people and machines in all spheres, including economy, education, industry and everyday life. Gaining awareness of technological, economic and socio-anthropological risks is the primary subject of this paper. The authors analyse various social transformation scenarios, which are fraught with tectonic shifts in the modern society: disappearance of the middle class and unqualified workers, decreasing migration of unskilled workers to Western countries and their self-isolation, and increasing potential migration of the middle class to developing countries. The paper conducts an Umwelt-analysis of both man-machine system development prospects and the danger of the technological singularity, when machines endowed with artificial intelligence may create an economic and political situation that would threaten human strategic domineering and the very existence of humankind. The authors ponder alternative paths for the evolution of humanity through supporting international consolidating megaprojects, establishing network civil society structures, building an economy of trust, releasing mankind's creative potential and spiritual values in the context of decreased industrial employment spurred on by the deployment of the digital economy, which will require a radical change in the aims and methods of education.;"[Budanov, Vladimir] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy, Dept Interdisciplinary Issues Sci & Technol Dev, 12-1 Goncharnaya Str, Moscow 109240, Russia; [Aseeva, Irina] Southwest State Univ, Dept Philosophy & Sociol, 94,50 Let Oktyabrya Str, Kursk 305040, Russia; [Zvonova, Ekaterina] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, 49 Leningradsky Ave, Moscow 125993, Russia";Budanov, V (reprint author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Philosophy, Dept Interdisciplinary Issues Sci & Technol Dev, 12-1 Goncharnaya Str, Moscow 109240, Russia.;"Zvonova, Ekaterina E./P-2582-2017; budanov, vladimir/G-6734-2016";"Zvonova, Ekaterina E./0000-0001-6397-5268; budanov, vladimir/0000-0003-2371-8659";;;;18;2;2;7;34;INST SOC TRANSFORMATION;KYIV;VUL GONCHARA 43-V, OFIS 20, KYIV, 01030, UKRAINE;1728-6220;1728-6239;;ECON ANN-XXI;Econ.

Despite the project's goal being to achieve the sum of human knowledge, there are strong content imbalances across the language editions. In order to quantify and investigate these imbalances, we study the impact of cultural context in 40 language editions. To this purpose, we developed a computational method to identify articles that can be related to the editors' cultural context associated to each Wikipedia language edition. We employed a combination of strategies taking into account geolocated articles, specific keywords and categories, as well as links between articles. We verified the method's quality with manual assessment and found an average precision of 0.92 and an average recall of 0.95. The results show that about a quarter of each Wikipedia language edition is dedicated to represent the corresponding cultural context. Although a considerable part of this content was created during the first years of the project, its creation is sustained over time. An analysis of cross-language coverage of this content shows that most of it is unique in its original language, and reveals special links between cultural contexts; at the same time, it highlights gaps where the encyclopedia could extend its content.

In its first part, the study addresses theoretical, conceptual, and methodological questions that arise from the specific materiality of the born-digital avant-texte, namely, the dualism of 'forensic materiality' and `formal materiality' (M. Kirschenbaum) and the role of distributed materiality (J.-F. Blanchette). The article argues that the born-digital record, consisting of digital objects, temporary files, metadata, and fragmented traces of the writing process scattered across multiple system locations, has to be analyzed with regard to the specific historical computing context, its distributed materiality ensemble of hardware, operating system, and application (multi-evidential perspective, J. L. John). Current challenges for born-digital preservation and philological analysis will be discussed. In the second part, the exemplary analysis of several digital drafts and text fragments found on the hard drives of German poet Thomas Kling (1957-2005) sheds light on digital materiality from a practical digital forensic and critique genetique perspective. The following methods will be demonstrated: analysis of fast save artifacts in Microsoft Word documents; draft text recovery from CHK files; file carving and verification of recovery results (true, false positives); recovery of text fragments from drive slack. Digital forensic methodology is in the focus of this article as a tool in the context of archival studies, philology, genetic criticism, and scholarly editing of born-digital material. As born-digital primary records of cultural, social, and political history (private storage media, cloud storage, world wide web content as well as public and semi-public social media posts) come to the archives in increasing numbers and volumes, the forensic perspective on born-digital material, questions of authentic preservation and analysis, bibliographic citability and stability, materiality and their status as a document and evidence as well as legal and ethical issues of preservation, curation and access in the archives become crucial for all humanities disciplines.";[Ries, Thorsten] Univ Ghent, Ghent, Belgium;Ries, T (reprint author), Univ Ghent, Duitse Letterkunde, Blandijnberg 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.;;;Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO), research project Hard Drive Philology [12Q9815N];This work was supported by the Research Foundation-Flanders (FWO), research project Hard Drive Philology.

Seventeen experts provided 42 propositions from ten different perspectives as input for the ERT. A full-day ERT deliberated communalities and relationships among these unseens and provided suggestions on (i) what the major unseens are; (ii) how rebound effects of digital transitioning may become the subject of overarching research; and (iii) what unseens should become subjects of transdisciplinary theory and practice processes for developing socially robust orientations. With respect to the latter, the experts suggested that the ownership, economic value, use and access of data and, related to this, algorithmic decision-making call for transdisciplinary processes that may provide guidelines for key stakeholder groups on how the responsible use of digital data can be developed. A cluster-based content analysis of the propositions, the discussion and inputs of the ERT, and a theoretical analysis of major changes to levels of human systems and the human-environment relationship resulted in the following greater picture: The digital transition calls for redefining economy, labor, democracy, and humanity. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based machines may take over major domains of human labor, reorganize supply chains, induce platform economics, and reshape the participation of economic actors in the value chain. (Digital) Knowledge and data supplement capital, labor, and natural resources as major economic variables. Digital data and technologies lead to a post-fuel industry (post-) capitalism. Traditional democratic processes can be (intentionally or unintentionally) altered by digital technologies. The unseens in this field call for special attention, research and management. Related to the conditions of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development (humanity), the ubiquitous, global, increasingly AI-shaped interlinkage of almost every human personal, social, and economic activity and the exposure to indirect, digital, artificial, fragmented, electronically mediated data affect behavioral, cognitive, psycho-neuro-endocrinological processes on the level of the individual and thus social relations (of groups and families) and culture, and thereby, the essential quality and character of the human being (i.e., humanity). The findings suggest a need for a new field of research, i.e., focusing on sustainable digital societies and environments, in which the identification, analysis, and management of vulnerabilities and unseens emerging in the sociotechnical digital transition play an important role.";"[Scholz, Roland W.; Prote, Jan Philipp] Danube Univ Krems, Dept Knowledge & Informat Management, A-3500 Krems An Der Donau, Austria; [Scholz, Roland W.] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Bartelsman, Eric J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bartelsman, Eric J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Tinbergen Inst, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Diefenbach, Sarah] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Psychol, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Franke, Lude] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Genet, NL-9700 CC Groningen, Netherlands; [Grunwald, Arnim] KIT, Inst Technol Assessment & Syst Anal ITAS, D-76131 Karlsruhe, Germany; [Grunwald, Arnim] Off Technol Assessment German Bundestag TAB, D-10178 Berlin, Germany; [Helbing, Dirk; Klauser, Stefan] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Humanities Social & Polit Sci, CH-9092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hill, Richard] Hill & Associates, CH-1207 Geneva, Switzerland; [Hilty, Lorenz] Univ Zurich, Dept Informat, CH-8050 Zurich, Switzerland; [Hilty, Lorenz] Swiss Fed Labs Mat Sci & Technol EMPA, CH-9014 St Gallen, Switzerland; [Hojer, Mattias] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Sustainable Dev Environm Sci & Engn, Div Strateg Sustainable Studies, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Montag, Christian] Ulm Univ, Inst Psychol & Educ, Dept Mol Psychol, D-89069 Ulm, Germany; [Montag, Christian] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Chengdu Brain Sci Inst, Clin Hosp, SCAN Lab, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Montag, Christian] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Key Lab Neuroinformat, Chengdu 611731, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Parycek, Peter] Ctr Competence Publ IT Fraunhofer FOKUS, D-10589 Berlin, Germany; [Parycek, Peter; Pereira, Gabriela Viale] Danube Univ Krems, Dept E Governance & Adm, A-3500 Krems An Der Donau, Austria; [Prote, Jan Philipp; Schuh, Guenther] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Lab Machine Tools & Prod Engn WZL, Prod Management Dept, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Renn, Ortwin] IASS, D-14467 Potsdam, Germany; [Reichel, Andre] ISM, D-70180 Stuttgart, Germany";"Scholz, RW (reprint author), Danube Univ Krems, Dept Knowledge & Informat Management, A-3500 Krems An Der Donau, Austria.; Scholz, RW (reprint author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Environm Syst Sci, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.";"Scholz, Roland W./B-2076-2008; Montag, Christian/H-6536-2019; Scholz, Roland/I-6534-2019";"Grunwald, Armin/0000-0003-3683-275X; Renn, Ortwin/0000-0002-2283-4247; Scholz, Roland/0000-0003-2506-3254; Montag, Christian/0000-0001-8112-0837; Hilty, Lorenz/0000-0001-5020-0586";German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Berlin;The European Round Table on Structuring Research on Sustainable Digital Environments received funding from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Berlin.;;153;2;2;1;30;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2071-1050;;;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;JUN;2018;10;6;;;;;;;2001;10.3390/su10062001;;;48;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";GK9LE;WOS:000436570100313;;DOAJ Gold, Green Accepted, Green Published;;;07/02/2020
J;Drucker, J;;;;Drucker, Johanna;;;Non-representational approaches to modeling interpretation in a graphical environment;DIGITAL SCHOLARSHIP IN THE HUMANITIES;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;This article presents an epistemological rationale, intellectual justification, and design outline for a non-representational approach to modeling interpretation in a graphical environment. It begins with a brief critical discussion of the representational approaches that are the common form of information visualizations and suggests that the less familiar non-representational approach could be used to augment these existing visualizations by supporting interpretative work that is closer to the practice of humanistic hermeneutic traditions. Representational display, based on large-scale processing, surrogates, and conventional visualizations, and non-representational modeling at the level of the individual interpretative act operate at very different scales to support intellectual work. In a representational approach, data precede display. Display is a surrogate produced according to automated protocols and algorithms. These cannot be altered or intervened except through rewriting their code, and the display, though interpretative and subject to interpretation, cannot be used as a means by which interpretation is actually modeled. While all visualizations express a model, they do not all provide a modeling environment. In the non-representational approach proposed here, graphical input serves as a primary means of interpretative work. More significantly, a graphical environment that supports direct modeling of interpretation allows traditional humanistic approaches, close reading, and marking of texts, documents, artifacts, or images, to be integrated with computationally produced visualizations.

This article contributes a fresh understanding by examining the material development of HumlabX, a research laboratory for digital humanities at Umea University, Sweden. Specifically, we approach the empirical case as a timeline of research funding, projects, events, and deliverables to examine how the research laboratory as an organizational and material space developed and evolved in relation to new technology investments. Based on our analysis, we argue that while digital research infrastructures can, indeed, stimulate innovation in and around research, aimed to produce new knowledge, digital technologies carry social and material implications that affect organizational processes. We show that while knowledge production processes at HumlabX were highly influenced by the infrastructural legacy of the past, they indeed directed scholars toward innovation. By discussing these implications in detail, we move beyond the debate of humanities qua digital, and demonstrate the need for scholars of digital humanities to engage in the development of policies for digital research infrastructures. Using a Swedish case study, we argue that research laboratories for the digital humanities must be scrutinized and should be fully exposed as socio-material organizations that develop, and should develop, over time. In particular, we stress the need to ensure that digital humanities laboratories are sustainable and open for redevelopment.;"[Foka, Anna; Misharina, Anna; Gelfgren, Stefan] Umea Univ, Humlab, Fabriksgatan 11, S-90331 Umea, Sweden; [Foka, Anna] Lund Univ, Pufendorf Inst, Fabriksgatan 11, S-90331 Lund, Sweden; [Arvidsson, Viktor] Univ Oslo, Dept Informat, Oslo, Norway";Foka, A (reprint author), Umea Univ, Humlab, Fabriksgatan 11, S-90331 Umea, Sweden.;Foka, Anna/A-8347-2017;Foka, Anna/0000-0002-9949-616X;;;;61;0;0;1;6;OXFORD UNIV PRESS;OXFORD;GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND;2055-7671;2055-768X;;DIGIT SCHOLARSH HUM;Digit.

This article reports on a pilot project at University College London, working in collaboration with the British Library, to scope out how best high-performance computing facilities can be used to facilitate the needs of researchers in the humanities. Using institutional data-processing frameworks routinely used to support scientific research, we assisted four humanities researchers in analysing 60,000 digitized books, and we present two resulting case studies here. This research allowed us to identify infrastructural and procedural barriers and make recommendations on resource allocation to best support non-computational researchers in undertaking 'big data' research. We recommend that research software engineer capacity can be most efficiently deployed in maintaining and supporting data sets, while librarians can provide an essential service in running initial, routine queries for humanities scholars. At present there are too many technical hurdles for most individuals in the humanities to consider analysing at scale these increasingly available open data sets, and by building on existing frameworks of support from research computing and library services, we can best support humanities scholars in developing methods and approaches to take advantage of these research opportunities.;"[Terras, Melissa; Beavan, David; Welsh, Anne; O'Neill, Helen; Duke-Williams, Oliver] UCL, Dept Informat Studies, London, England; [Terras, Melissa; Beavan, David] UCL, UCL Ctr Digital Humanities, London, England; [Baker, James] Univ Sussex, Sch Hist Art Hist & Philosophy, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Hetherington, James] UCL, Res IT Serv, Res Software Dev Grp, London, England; [Austwick, Martin Zaltz] UCL, Ctr Adv Spatial Anal, London, England; [O'Neill, Helen] London Lib, London, England; [Finley, Will] Univ Sheffield, Dept Hist, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Farquhar, Adam] British Lib, Digital Scholarship, London, England";Terras, M (reprint author), UCL, Dept Informat Studies, Foster Court, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.;;Beavan, David/0000-0002-0347-6659;pilot grant from the Jisc Research Data Spring [JISC 3548];This project was funded by a pilot grant from the Jisc Research Data Spring (JISC 3548) between April and July 2015.

The images were registered into the British Museum's permanent collection and treated as objects in their own right, not just digital reproductions of objects. As a wholly born-digital collection, this led to several opportunities and challenges for documentation, dissemination, and digital humanities outputs, including a fully searchable database, social media, website, 3D modelling and printing, and virtual reality, to name a few. Increasingly, digital technologies are being used in standard archaeological research and practice. From digital photography to larger 3D modelling/scanning, the volume of data being created by archaeologists is increasing exponentially, as is the potential for these outputs to change research and community engagement. But with the massive amounts of data being created, are researchers documenting and disseminating their data to their full potential? Here, traditional museum practices of cataloguing, storing, and public engagement can inform archaeological practice to use these data collections for both scholarly research and community engagement. Through a critically reflective description of the work and challenges of the project, this paper argues that there are significant benefits to be gained by engaging digital rock art projects with established museum thinking and practice.;"[Anderson, Helen; Galvin, Elizabeth; Rodriguez, Jorge de Torres] Dept Africa, Grid 29109 33, Oceania & Amer, British Museum, London WC1B3DG, *, *; [Anderson, Helen; Galvin, Elizabeth; Rodriguez, Jorge de Torres] British Museum, Dept Africa Oceania & Amer, Great Russell St, London WC1B 3DG, *, England";Galvin, E (reprint author), British Museum, Dept Africa Oceania & Amer, Great Russell St, London WC1B 3DG, *, England.;;;Arcadia Fund [3357];The African Rock Art Image Project at the British Museum is funded by The Arcadia Fund (Grant 3357).;;65;0;0;1;5;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0263-0338;1572-9842;;AFR ARCHAEOL REV;Afr.

This article discusses when and why Scandinavianism entered into political language as a powerful new concept capable of setting a future-oriented agenda. After analyzing digitized newspaper material and other relevant publications in Norway, Sweden, and Denmark and after using a combination of distant and close reading, it concludes that Scandinavianism as a neologism only appeared as late as 1843. This article aims to contribute to a conceptual transnational history of Scandinavianism by examining its emergence, reception, and discursive context in the early 1840s.;"[Hemstad, Ruth] Natl Lib Norway, Oslo, Norway; [Hemstad, Ruth] Univ Oslo, Hist, Oslo, Norway";"Hemstad, R (reprint author), Natl Lib Norway, Oslo, Norway.; Hemstad, R (reprint author), Univ Oslo, Hist, Oslo, Norway.";;;;;;44;0;0;1;2;BERGHAHN JOURNALS;BROOKLYN;20 JAY ST, SUITE 512, BROOKLYN, NY 11201 USA;1807-9326;1874-656X;;CONTRIB HIST CONCEPT;Contrib.

Using a sample of 4953 digital start-ups the paper evaluates the impact of start-up founding teams' higher education on the probability of securing equity investment and subsequent exit for investors. The main findings are: (1), teams with a founder that has a technical education are less likely to remain self-financed and are more likely to secure equity investment and to exit, but the impact of technical education declines with higher level degrees, (2) teams with a founder that has doctoral level business education are less likely to remain self-financed and have a higher probability of securing equity investment, while undergraduate and postgraduate business education have no significant effect, and (3) teams with a founder that has an undergraduate general education (arts and humanities) are less likely to remain self-financed and are more likely to secure equity investment and exit while postgraduate and doctoral general education have no significant effect on securing equity investment and exit. The findings enhance our understanding of factors that influence digital start-ups achieving equity milestones by showing the heterogeneous influence of different types of higher education, and therefore human capital, on new ventures achieving equity milestones. The results suggest that researchers and policy-makers should extend their consideration of universities entrepreneurial activity to include the development of human capital.;"[Ratzinger, Daniel; Greenman, Andrew; Mosey, Simon] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Haydn Green Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Nottingham, England; [Amess, Kevin] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Nottingham, England";Ratzinger, D (reprint author), Univ Nottingham, Nottingham Univ Business Sch, Haydn Green Inst Innovat & Entrepreneurship, Nottingham, England.;Greenman, Andrew/L-1866-2019;"Greenman, Andrew/0000-0002-6617-9344; Mosey, Simon/0000-0002-3452-5230";"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council through the Horizon Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Nottingham [EP/G037574/1, EP/G065802/1]; RCUK's Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute";This work was supported by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (grant numbers EP/G037574/1, EP/G065802/1) through the Horizon Centre for Doctoral Training at the University of Nottingham and the RCUK's Horizon Digital Economy Research Institute.

GS is a scholarly communications research laboratory dedicated to using collaborative models and design principles in the creation of scholarly works. Scholarship laboratories that function as a combination of a scientific research lab and an art studio are a useful means of advancing the methods and outcomes of scholarly communications. We intend to examine whether flattening hierarchies through the GS model is a significant challenge for librarians who work within transactional models of interaction and are closely tied to faculty-driven service models of research support. Other participants typically thought of as supporting faculty are embedded as equal participants in the design process. We will apply qualitative methods to examine whether the GS design process facilitates development of new models of interaction among faculty, librarians, design technologists and other experts. Preliminary experience finds most participants embrace the collaborative model and are energized by the experience. Our assessment will focus on GS techniques as drivers for role and scholarly output changes, how these experiences might translate into changes in library culture or services, and on practical findings related to space, technology usage and administrative hurdles.

Traditionally, impact has been measured by citations; yet these are problematic metrics for nontraditional outputs like sound recordings. Social media data provide a promising avenue of investigation for measuring scholarly as well as societal impact. Twitter in particular has been shown to provide a high number of references for cultural and research outputs in all disciplines. This study analyzes Twitter references pertaining to the collections of five digital sound archives: British Library Sounds, Europeana Sounds, the Internet Archive Audio Archive, PennSound, and UbuWeb. By using text analysis methods to identify high-frequency events and trends, and labeling them with a rubric designed for measuring the impact of digital heritage resources, this study provides preliminary insights on user values as they relate to digital sound collections. Despite the limitations of using social media data, the evidence gathered in this case study characterizes aspects of the use of digital sound collections, and may point to future priorities for the digital preservation of sound.";[Giannetti, Francesca] Rutgers State Univ, Archibald S Alexander Lib, 169 Coll Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA;Giannetti, F (reprint author), Rutgers State Univ, Archibald S Alexander Lib, 169 Coll Ave, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.;;Giannetti, Francesca/0000-0001-9022-7134;;;;55;1;1;4;50;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;2330-1635;2330-1643;;J ASSOC INF SCI TECH;;MAY;2018;69;5;;;;;687;699;;10.1002/asi.23990;;;13;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Information Science & Library Science";"Computer Science; Information Science & Library Science";GC9OA;WOS:000430126400005;;;;;07/02/2020

This effect is more profound for volume of visual-spatial domain of WM, while volume of WM phonological loop, associated with processing of auditory and phonological information has no or little effect on mathematical abilities in adults. However the role of the brain language network at mathematical cognition is still under discussion. We examined the effect of WM in phonological loop using a simple forward digital span test at the speed and correctness of solving different mathematical versus verbal tasks in healthy right handed young volunteers with higher education or students in math and humanities. The correctness (C) and time of the task solving (TS) was significantly better in Math group (N=10), than in Humanitarian group of subjects (N=10). The WM volume did not differ between the groups, but affected differently C and TS of tasks in mathematicians and humanitarians. Spearman' correlation analysis for separate groups showed that WM affected the C of solving the mathematical tasks in Math group but not TS, while in Humanitarian group we observed the opposite tendency. Remarkably, the WM correlated negatively with TS of logical task for arithmetical sequences in Math group. Our results imply that WM in verbal domain may influence mathematical abilities especially when they require involvement of logical thinking.;"[Chemerisova, E. V.; Martynova, O.

Through classroom observations, interviews with students and teachers, and analysis of the work produced by students in three 9th-grade English classrooms, this study builds on existing assumptions about the role technology plays in schools. Rather than simply noting how technology enables and strengthens digital production practices and access in English classrooms, we argue that technology mediates student identities and helps students articulate the complex cultural experiences and beliefs that they bring daily into schools. Further, by exploring how student beliefs about identity and society were couched in statements about technology, this study connects English classroom discussions about technology to broader understandings of the world beyond schools. Through our analysis of student talk, student writing, and classroom observations, we identified three ways that students described technology. When engaging in the curriculum, students represented technology as invisible or in relation to humanity, and frequently explored the relationship between technology, society, and power. Ultimately, this study suggests that when considering how technology layers meanings of power within schools, we must view technology according to the domains in which it does and does not ""count"" in students' eyes. The implementation of technology in English classrooms is far more complicated than the utilization of tools. It is about power, student identity, and positioning.";"[Garcia, Antero] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Stamatis, Kristina; Kelly, Mary] Univ Colorado, Sch Educ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA";Garcia, A (reprint author), Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.;;;George Lucas Educational Foundation;Funding for this research was provided by the George Lucas Educational Foundation.;;55;1;1;1;3;NATL COUNCIL TEACHERS ENGLISH;URBANA;1111 KENYON RD, URBANA, IL 61801 USA;0034-527X;;;RES TEACH ENGL;Res.

Existing efforts to curate and publish datasets take a top-down approach and are focused on large collections, produce scarce metadata, require expertise for effective integration, provide poor user support while producing mappings, and present issues at data access. This paper presents the datalegend platform, which addresses the long tail of research data by catering for the needs of individual scholars. datalegend allows researchers to publish their (small) datasets, link them to existing vocabularies and other datasets, and thereby contribute to a growing collection of interlinked datasets.

As a consequence, new ways of thinking in wider contexts and organizing research on a larger scale came within reach of disciplines that had previously mostly been active on an individual level and focusing on particular phenomena. Moreover, applications of new scientific methods led to breakthroughs in fundamental humanities issues such as environmental and biological data that were essential for living conditions and for the formation of collective identities.

The author first offers a reflection on the evolution of humanism in modern Chinese intellectual history. To the author, we are now in a 'post-theoretical era', in which the function of theory is no longer so powerful and ubiquitous as it used to be. It is then argued that the rise of the post-humanist' trend in the West during the past decades indicates that, in the present era, humankind is only one of many species on earth, whose existence and development, to a large extent, depend on natural law. At the same time, post-humanism tells us that humankind may no longer be able to control some of its own creations.

Three hundred and eight teachers from this university completed an online questionnaire and 30 of them participated in a follow-up interview. Survey results showed that while there was a strong positive correlation between using mobile technologies for personal learning and their use in teaching, only a small number of participants utilised mobile technologies in their learning and the vast majority also did not use these technologies in their teaching, More female teachers and humanities teachers used mobile devices and applications more frequently than male teachers and teachers from other academic disciplines. Also, female teachers had a more positive perception in learning and using mobile technologies. Junior teachers also tended to be more positive in technology use. While the overwhelming majority of the interview participants also perceived positive benefits of incorporating mobile devices and applications into their teaching, it was found that female teachers paid greater attention to pedagogy when considering mobile technology use and the lack of professional development limited their use in teaching.;"[Lai, Kwok-Wing] Univ Otago, Coll Educ, Educ, Dunedin, New Zealand; [Smith, Lee] Univ Otago, Fac Dent, Dept Oral Sci, Dunedin, New Zealand";Lai, KW (reprint author), Univ Otago, Coll Educ, 145 Union St East, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.;;;University of Otago;This project was funded by a Teaching Development Grant from the University of Otago.

Online learning technologies are becoming increasingly widespread in the non-formal education sector and in higher and supplementary vocational education. The use of MOOCs in Russia to support the delivery of educational programmes at university level opens opportunities in terms of expanding the educational choice for students, the development of virtual academic mobility, reduction in the cost of educational services, and improvement in the accessibility of education. However, the effectiveness of using different online learning technologies at university level, and the consequences of their widespread adoption, has not been sufficiently explored. In this research study, a comparative analysis is made of the effects of different online learning models on student educational outcomes in a university setting. A study was undertaken in which different groups of students at the Ural Federal University, Russia, were encouraged to study technical and humanities disciplines using a framework of blended learning, and online learning with tutoring support. The results of the study were compared with the results of a reference (control) group of students who studied the same disciplines in a traditionally taught model. It was found that both models (blended and online) of MOOC implementation demonstrated greater learning gains, in comparison with the traditional model. For engineering and technical disciplines, there was no statistically significant difference between blended or online learning technologies. For the humanities discipline, where the communicative component of the learning process was significant, the blended learning technology produced better results. Conclusions of this empirical research may be useful for heads of educational organizations and teachers in helping them to make strategic decisions about the modernization of university courses by increasing the effectiveness of the implementation of new educational technologies. The results of this research project will be used for implementing the State Priority Project, 'The Modern Digital Educational Environment of the Russian Federation'.;"[Larionova, Viola] Ural Fed Univ, Acad Dept Econ & Management Construct & Real Esta, Grad Sch Econ & Management, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia; [Bystrova, Tatiana] Ural Fed Univ, Acad Dept Cultural Studies & Design, Philosophy, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Bystrova, Tatiana] Ural Fed Univ, Acad Dept Cultural Studies & Design, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Sinitsyn, Evgueny] Ural Fed Univ, Acad Dept Syst & Decis Making Anal, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Phys & Math, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Sinitsyn, Evgueny] Ural Fed Univ, Acad Dept Syst & Decis Making Anal, Grad Sch Econ & Management, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Brown, Ken] Letterkenny Inst Technol, Sch Engn, Letterkenny, Ireland";Larionova, V (reprint author), Ural Fed Univ, Acad Dept Econ & Management Construct & Real Esta, Grad Sch Econ & Management, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.;"Larionova, Viola A/B-3171-2015; Pimentel, Priscilla/AAG-6402-2019";"Larionova, Viola A/0000-0002-2132-5176; Brown, Ken/0000-0001-8863-1410";Russian Scientific FoundationRussian Science Foundation (RSF) [15-18-10014];"The authors would like to express their deepest gratitude to the Russian Scientific Foundation for the support of the research within the project number 15-18-10014, ""Designing Optimal Social and Economic Systems in the Context of Turbulence of External and Internal Environment'.";;39;7;8;1;25;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1745-4999;;;RES COMP INT EDUC;Res.

Rather, diverse mental states, which are often diagnosed as ""mental illness,"" take shape within greater environmental forces and flows, including those that are constructed online. Drawing from a multi-sited ethnography of The Icarus Project, a radical mental health community, the author situates online narratives written by two of its members within posthuman emotional ecologies in which the exchange of ideas online affects mental states in a profound way. These narratives can be seen as a new type of psychiatric resistance based in new technologies, one that ""uncivilizes"" mental illness by searching for alternative frameworks and metaphors to understand lived experiences with mental distress. This ethnographic perspective differs significantly from traditional bio-psychiatric models and interventions and can offer both patients and mental healthcare providers with an alternative language to frame mental health.";[Fletcher, Erica Hua] Univ Houston, Honors Coll, Houston, TX 77004 USA;Fletcher, EH (reprint author), Univ Houston, Honors Coll, Houston, TX 77004 USA.;;;Jeane B.

The second section explores how digital archives of both digitized materials and born-digital ones have intersected with the origin and consolidation of the Digital Humanities in the US, underscoring the way these intersections have fostered the development of suitable methodologies and vocabularies to examine digitized and born-digital cultural products. The third section explores a handful of Mexican projects developed in the last few years, and proposes that Mexican digital literary scholarship is unique in its emphasis on decolonial perspectives, community building and recovery, education and training, and new creative expressions.;[Ortega, Elika] Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA;Ortega, E (reprint author), Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.;;;;;;25;0;0;3;14;UNIV PENNSYLVANIA PRESS;PHILADELPHIA;3905 SPRUCE STREET, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19104-4112 USA;0018-2176;1553-0639;;HISPANIC REV;Hisp.

She became both a symbol of his loss, and a living monument to his legacyan ambassador between the living and the dead. Responsible not only for preserving his memory on earth, a widow was also expected to pray on behalf of her husband's soul, to work to rescue him from the torments of Purgatory through her dutiful appeals. Widows were at once asked to pray quietly alone, and tasked with work central to society: the salvation of souls after death. This dual identity-sometimes isolated, yet of fundamental importance-makes the widow an opportune subject for students of early modern conceptions of the relationship between religion and gender. In this essay, I look at widows in Lucrezia Tornabuoni's Judith, Hebrew Widow and Antonia Tanini Pulci's The Destruction of Saul and the Lament of David. Taught side-by-side, these texts provide students with multiple, interconnected ports of entry into the early modern world, encouraging an investigation of how the two women writers worked to place widows at the center of their respective stories, rather than relegated to the margins.;[Wainwright, Anna] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Class Humanities & Italian Studies, Durham, NH 03824 USA;Wainwright, A (reprint author), Univ New Hampshire, Dept Class Humanities & Italian Studies, Durham, NH 03824 USA.;;;;;;33;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2077-1444;;;RELIGIONS;Religions;MAR;2018;9;3;;;;;;;76;10.3390/rel9030076;;;13;Religion;Religion;GA7KH;WOS:000428514500012;;DOAJ Gold;;;07/02/2020
J;Tsatsou, P;;;;Tsatsou, Panayiota;;;Literacy and training in digital research: Researchers' views in five social science and humanities disciplines;NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Digital literacy; digital research; humanities; interviews; social sciences; training";"OCCUPY WALL-STREET; MEDIA LITERACY; INFORMATION LITERACY; INTERNET; TWITTER; ENGAGEMENT; PROTEST; SKILLS; USER";This article examines the views of researchers in five social science and humanities disciplines on their digital literacy and the training they need or have undertaken. Theoretically, this article draws upon two competing conceptualisations of digital literacy: digital literacy as user skills' and digital literacy as user-technology interactivity'. Empirically, it suggests that social science and humanities researchers' understandings and evaluations of their digital literacy unfold at two levels - the factual and the perceptual - and involve not only (technical) skills but also user experiences, emotions and complex processes of learning, practising and self-development when interacting with technology. Furthermore, researchers challenge the value of generic institutional training for literacy enhancement and envision the development of informal communities of experience exchange and knowledge-sharing across the research community. These findings lead to recommendations on training provision and support the conceptualisation of digital literacy as a process where user interactivity with technology results in certain experiences, reflections and lessons, rather than merely reflecting users' technical skills.;[Tsatsou, Panayiota] Univ Leicester, Media & Commun, Leicester, Leics, England;Tsatsou, P (reprint author), Univ Leicester, Sch Media Commun & Sociol, Bankfield House,132 New Walk, Leicester LE1 7JA, Leics, England.;Tsatsou, Panayiota/I-1883-2013;Tsatsou, Panayiota/0000-0001-6670-4711;;;;61;2;2;7;32;SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD;LONDON;1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND;1461-4448;1461-7315;;NEW MEDIA SOC;New Media Soc.;MAR;2018;20;3;;;;;1240;1259;;10.1177/1461444816688274;;;20;Communication;Communication;GC6KF;WOS:000429899100022;;;;;07/02/2020

The complexities of these sites and the competing narratives that surround them are difficult for students to grasp in a condensed period of time. Using approaches from the spatial humanities, this article offers a case study for enhancing student learning through the creation of digital maps and itineraries in a campus-based course for subsequent use during a three-week program in Berlin. In particular, the concept of deep mapping is discussed as a means of augmenting understanding of the city and its history from a narrative across time to a narrative across the physical space of the city. As itineraries, these course-based projects were replicated on site. In moving from the digital environment to the urban landscape, this article concludes by noting meanings uncovered and narratives formed as we moved through the physical space of the city.;[Apgar, Richard B.] Sewanee Univ South, German, Sewanee, TN 37383 USA;Apgar, RB (reprint author), Sewanee Univ South, German, Sewanee, TN 37383 USA.;;;;;;10;0;0;0;0;EDINBURGH UNIV PRESS;EDINBURGH;THE TUN-HOLYROOD RD, 12 2F JACKSONS ENTRY, EDINBURGH EH8 8PJ, SCOTLAND;1753-8548;1755-1706;;INT J HUMANIT ARTS C;Int.

In method, the essay lays out a comparative model for the analysis of maps across early modern and contemporary digital practices by theorizing student-driven practices of mapping first through a deep attention to historical location and documentary evidence, and second, through an inquiry into the digital implications of mapping jurisdictional conflicts through case studies focused on westward expansion in the West Indies.

This reflects an anxiety about the authority of humanistic research that has historical roots, some of them well described in the work of the social anthropologist Ernest Gellner. The ""two cultures"" debate of the early 1960s, centrally animated by C. P. Snow and F. R. Leavis, made the anxiety of the literary professoriat a matter of public debate that still inflects literary scholarship and theory. The rhetorical amplification of scientism, privileging scientific methodologies or partnership with scientific methodologies, in recent literary-critical scholarship is one result. The older formation of ""humanities computing,"" for example, has reemerged as the digital humanities, with claims to the status of interpretive methodology, particularly in the work of Franco Moretti.

J;Grimshaw, M;;;;Grimshaw, Mike;;;Towards a manifesto for a critical digital humanities: critiquing the extractive capitalism of digital society;PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;"This article proceeds in two distinct parts. The first section engages with a deliberately small number of popular texts written by discriminating and interrogative consumers and producers of digital culture and society. While these may be dismissed as journalistic texts and sources by those of a more focused academic intent, here these texts are used because they are the connection between academic engagement and wider public readership. As such, they frame what can be termed the critical public engagement with digital capitalism. These texts are read in tandem with my thesis of immaterial capitalism and Marazzi's' The Violence of Financial Capitalism. The paper then concludes with what can be described as the 'manifesto turn' by raising some questions for a renewed engagement with digital society, to be undertaken from what is termed, an emergent critical digital humanities, as the site of critique and resistance. This is an exercise in what can be labelled Mongrel methodology and ideology, a neo-logism deliberately provocative in intent to signal a post-academic approach, chosen over such traditional descriptors as mixed-methods or assemblage and the like. As such, it may draw on Marxist thought but is not Marxist in ideology or final intent; it is critical of capitalism but acknowledges our on-going existence and possibilities within it; it is written by an academic seeking to act as intermediary between academic and non-academic readings and responses. It is a deliberate act of provocation as a manifesto call for change.";[Grimshaw, Mike] Univ Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand;Grimshaw, M (reprint author), Univ Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand.;;;;;;29;1;1;1;2;PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD;BASINGSTOKE;BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND;2055-1045;;;PALGR COMMUN;Palgr.

J;Paige, N;;;;Paige, Nicholas;;;The Artifactuality of Narrative Form: First-Person Novels in France, 1601-1830;POETICS TODAY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"periodization; first-person novel; quantitative literary history; digital humanities; literary evolution";;When literary scholars analyze narrative personhood historically, they typically see periods, explained as an effect of deeper psychosocial mutations. Thus the dominant first person of the eighteenth century is the counterpart to a new bourgeois subject, while the third-person omniscience of the nineteenth might reflect an age of increasing state control. The article argues that only our impressionistic use of mostly canonical examples permits such sweeping statements and that the very notion of the period (never mind episteme or paradigm) is undermined by a quantitative examination of the literary archive and its evolution. Based on a systematic sample of French novels over twenty-three decades, this study concludes that narrative forms such as the memoir novel and the epistolary novel behave as successful artifacts. As they spread, they achieve a recognizable form that peaks at a certain point, after which use steadily declines. Because the novel as a whole is composed of multiple forms in constant flux, it becomes impossible to isolate periods of homogeneous practice that could be said to operate according to some deeper sociocultural logic.;[Paige, Nicholas] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept French, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA;Paige, N (reprint author), Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept French, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;;;;;;38;0;0;1;1;DUKE UNIV PRESS;DURHAM;905 W MAIN ST, STE 18-B, DURHAM, NC 27701 USA;0333-5372;;;POETICS TODAY;Poetics Today;FEB;2018;39;1;;;;;41;65;;10.1215/03335372-4265059;;;25;Literature;Literature;FX2AA;WOS:000425857600003;;;;;07/02/2020

The IoT builds on (1) broadband wireless internet connectivity, (2) miniaturized sensors embedded in animate and inanimate objects ranging from the house cat to the milk carton in your smart fridge, and (3) AI and cobots making sense of Big Data collected by sensors. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech strategy for manufacturing automation that employs the IoT, thus creating the Smart Factory. Extreme automation until ""everything is connected to everything else"" poses, however, vulnerabilities that have been little considered to date. First, highly integrated systems are vulnerable to systemic risks such as total network collapse in the event of failure of one of its parts, for example, by hacking or Internet viruses that can fully invade integrated systems. Second, extreme connectivity creates new social and political power structures. If left unchecked, they might lead to authoritarian governance by one person in total control of network power, directly or through her/his connected surrogates. We propose in this study, Industry 5.0 that can democratize knowledge coproduction from Big Data, building on the new concept of symmetrical innovation. Industry 5.0 utilizes IoT, but differs from predecessor automation systems by having three-dimensional (3D) symmetry in innovation ecosystem design: (1) a built-in safe exit strategy in case of demise of hyperconnected entrenched digital knowledge networks. Importantly, such safe exists are orthogonalin that they allow ""digital detox"" by employing pathways unrelated/unaffected by automated networks, for example, electronic patient records versus material/article trails on vital medical information; (2) equal emphasis on both acceleration and deceleration of innovation if diminishing returns become apparent; and (3) next generation social science and humanities (SSH) research for global governance of emerging technologies: ""Post-ELSI Technology Evaluation Research"" (PETER). Importantly, PETER considers the technology opportunity costs, ethics, ethics-of-ethics, framings (epistemology), independence, and reflexivity of SSH research in technology policymaking.

The wide-ranging content of the gazettes, coupled with their insights into nineteenth-century women's education and early American periodical culture, suggests their broad appeal to scholars in multiple literary and historical fields. The gazettes, this article argues, represent a distinctive form of early nineteenth-century American authorship and literary production through their mixture of personal, academic, and public literacies. This article also highlights the potential value of the digital humanities, both as a toot for conducting research on the gazettes and as a way to make them accessible to a wider range of scholars, educators, and students by creating digital editions of all eighteen issues of The School Gazette and The Levee Gazette.;[McCown, Julie] Southern Utah Univ, English, Cedar City, UT 84720 USA;McCown, J (reprint author), Southern Utah Univ, English, Cedar City, UT 84720 USA.;;;;;;42;0;0;1;1;PENN STATE UNIV PRESS;UNIVERSITY PK;820 NORTH UNIV DRIVE, U S B 1, STE C, UNIVERSITY PK, PA 16802 USA;0048-7384;;;RESOUR AM LIT STUD;Resour.

Currently there are works that exploit the Diplomatics method for new issues such as the document of the Modern Ages, the administrative document, the notarial institutition, the mercantile document, the lordly chancelleries, the lay cartularies. In the present work, we intend to make an assessment of the expansion of the discipline in recent decades and outline the different paths to be taken. We also intend to analyze the relationship of the Diplomatic with new technologies, from the point of view of the possibilities for teaching, as well as, the potential of editing with XML markup languages to expand the knowledge of the discipline.;[Vigil Montes, Nestor] Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain;Montes, NV (reprint author), Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain.;;;;;;105;0;0;0;0;UNIV COIMBRA, FAC LETRAS;COIMBRA;CENTRO HIST SOCIEDADE, LARGO PORTA FERREA, COIMBRA, 3004-530, PORTUGAL;0870-4147;2183-3796;;REV PORT HIST;Rev.

It argues that attempts to couch powerful tools in what is often false familiarity, directly undermines the goal of encouraging scholarly innovation and risk taking.

J;Miller, A;;;;Miller, A.;;;Text Mining Digital Humanities Projects: Assessing Content Analysis Capabilities of Voyant Tools;JOURNAL OF WEB LIBRARIANSHIP;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Content analysis; data visualization; digital humanities; digital scholarship; Drupal; text-mining; Voyant Tools";;Text mining is a method that aids in the analytic process and interpretation of research. Voyant Tools (voyant tools.org ) is an open source text-mining option that is user-friendly and well documented. This tool was chosen as a test study for one of the latest projects, entitled Trials and Triumphs, at Middle Tennessee State University. The Trials and Triumphs project has been reengineered with new content, themes, and connections relating to Tennessee's history between 1865 and 1965. Transformations are not just the subject during this historic time period but are equally met with transformative technical upgrades to the project's previous interpretative layout. Digital Scholarship Initiatives at Middle Tennessee State University's Walker Library tested the application and use of Voyant Tools to determine whether its text analysis capabilities are well suited for the Trials and Triumphs revitalization project (now called Trials, Triumphs, and Transformations: Tennesseans' Search for Citizenship, Community, and Opportunity) and whether its interoperability with Drupal was worth pursuing. The author describes the results of this test study and consequently intends this article to be a practical guide for librarians or similar scholars who develop digital humanities projects, and who are interested in beginning a text mining project.;[Miller, A.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA;Miller, A (reprint author), Middle Tennessee State Univ, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA.;;;;;;11;1;1;4;6;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1932-2909;1932-2917;;J WEB LIBRARIANSH;J.

This widespread transformation is rooted in a growing interest in showing data together with synthesis and argument, the importance afforded to public engagement, and the proliferation of digital platforms that enable creative presentations of scholarly work. In this context, we discuss our experience producing an excavation report that attempts to integrate several forms of scholarly and public-facing communication on a digital platform, and aims to engage audiences at multiple levels, while simultaneously facilitating data reuse and laying out the authors' current interpretations. We consider the benefits and challenges of producing work in this way through the example of producing the Gabii Project's first volume, A Mid-Republican House from Gabii, developed through a collaboration between the Gabii Project team and the University of Michigan Press. This experience is contextualized within the broader discourse surrounding changing expectations about open access, authorship and credit, and sustainability of digital scholarship in academic publishing.;[Opitz, Rachel] Univ Glasgow, Archaeol, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland;Opitz, R (reprint author), Univ Glasgow, Sch Humanities, Archaeol, Gregory Bldg, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.;;;"Andrew W.

At the same time it remains somewhat unclear which technologies and practices belong to Digital Humanities and which of these should be taught in the humanities curricula. Also, there is a critical discussion about how the use of DH-technologies is going to transform the humanities and whether this is desirable. In this review-article we take a look at a) some of the introductory and textbook literature on Digital Humanities, including printed as well as internet resources, and b) some of the literature and internet blogs that aim at a critical discussion of Digital Humanities. Finally, c) we also take a look at the discussion about the current state of Open Access, which to us seems to be a pre-requirement to fully exploit the potential the internet-technology for the humanities. We find that by now a considerable introductory literature on DH-technologies exists, though at least the printed books are often collected volumes that provide a somewhat inhomogeneous reading experience.

One such treasure cataloged in The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State) Libraries is a collection of over 33,000 Sanborn (TM) Fire Insurance Maps. Originally kept safe in metal drawers, the library has embarked on a journey to digitize this abundance of information, combine it with other media such as photographs, and make it accessible through a web interface. Inspired by these efforts we accessed this information and took it to the next level. Using state of the art 3D modeling and immersive technologies, we created a historic 3D model and immersive experiences of Penn State, exemplarily for the 1922 campus. The resulting experiences can be accessed through the web but also through head mounted displays (HMDs) and mobile phones in combination with VR viewers such as the Google Cardboard. Additionally, they can be used anywhere in the world or on the campus itself as a way to enable remote and in situ experiences and learning.

The paper focuses on the representation of Croatian philosophers in specialized encyclopedias and dictionaries. Main areas at the intersection of the two disciplines are targeted: generating repositories, creating social networks for experts, and new approaches to analyzing digitalized content. In this context, the paper analyzes the (under-) representation of several Croatian philosophers in tertiary sources. The results show that the number of philosophers with name entries in encyclopedias is small, that the number of languages for the existing articles is also small, and that there are certain inaccuracies in those articles. Finally, the paper suggests certain procedures to remedy the present condition.[1];"[Ciric, Josip; Jadresin, Maja] Univ Zadar, Zadar, Croatia";Ciric, J (reprint author), Univ Zadar, Zadar, Croatia.;;;;;;67;0;0;0;0;UNIV ZADAR;ZADAR;MIHOVILA PAVLINOVICA, ZADAR, 23000, CROATIA;1847-7755;;;SIC;Sic;;2018;;16;;;;;;;;10.15291/sic/2.8.lc.2;;;22;Literature;Literature;HK9RK;WOS:000458329300013;;DOAJ Gold;;;07/02/2020

Libraries are more and more regarded as powers that create and connect communities. The National Library of Estonia keeps that in mind when maintaining and establishing networks both as a humanities library as well as a social sciences and parliamentary library. Partnerships with libraries and memory institutions are especially important, as we are becoming a central service development institution for Estonian libraries. A great change has taken place in our way of thinking. The National Library of Estonia is no longer collection-centred, not only carrying out the mission to preserve cultural heritage, but is also human-centred, customer-centred. Our goals are to make collections available as much as possible, to address our users, and to provide an inspiring environment via the library space. The modern national library should indeed remind of a modern public library - the library of the whole nation. It is a place from where to draw inspiration, where to create and expose the creation, and where to hold discussions and debates. Today we offer a bulk of digital content as open data and the development of digital humanities services is in progress. Still we have to admit that the library's role in teaching people how to use (open) data and how to support users with digital competencies should increase. Libraries are facing a never-ending work in developing the digital competences of their staff, who, in turn, will teach the library users, the citizens of e-governed state. The vision of the National Library of Estonia for the coming years is to be the library of a new generation and the developer of librarianship ideas by providing an open, inspiring, and participatory environment for activities. We have used a metaphor of a bridge while drawing up our new strategy. We aim to create a bridge between knowledge and people. A bridge that every new generation will build again and what will become ever more telling, significant and lasting by every generation.;[Andresoo, Jane] Natl Lib Estonia, Tallinn, Estonia;Andresoo, J (reprint author), Natl Lib Estonia, Tallinn, Estonia.;;;;;;7;0;0;1;1;NATL & UNIV LIBRARY BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA;SARAJEVO;ZMAJA OD BOSNE 8B, SARAJEVO, 71000, BOSNIA & HERCEG;1512-5033;2303-8888;;BOSNIACA;Bosniaca;;2018;;23;;;;;90;94;;;;;5;Information Science & Library Science;Information Science & Library Science;HJ3CJ;WOS:000457046900011;;;;;07/02/2020

J;Blanke, T;;;;Blanke, Tobias;;;Predicting the Past;DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;"MACHINE LEARNING-METHODS; HUMANITIES";Digital humanities have a long tradition of using advanced computational techniques and machine learning to aid humanistic enquiry. In this paper, we concentrate on a specific subfield of machine learning called predictive analytics and its use in digital humanities. Predictive analytics has evolved from descriptive analytics, which creates summaries of data, while predictive analytics predicts relationships within the data that also help to explain new data. Predictive analytics uses machine learning techniques but also traditional statistical methods. It uses properties (or features) of the data to predict another target feature in the data. Machine learning is used by predictive analytics to establish the rules that given a certain combination of features make the target more or less likely.

J;Edmond, J;;;;Edmond, Jennifer;;;How Scholars Read Now: When the Signal Is the Noise;DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;"Distraction is not a problem for scholarly reading in the humanities: it is, in fact, intrinsic to how we work. An openness to distraction facilitates knowledge creation in conversation with and between sources, bringing together disparate times and places, authors and forms of source material, frames of reference and layers of insight, harnessing peripheral vision as much as central focus to create the conditions for serendipitous discovery. This ""loose hold"" on focus results in a knowledgescape with a substantial tacit dimension, with the result that humanists most certainly know more than we can tell. This is not to say that the epistemic process of the humanist is all encompassing, however: administrative work, for example, is viewed as a ""true"" distraction, and managed accordingly. In spite of the wide availability of digital tools to consolidate and organise the process of extracting information from the reading of sources (be they text, image, landscape or indeed even the self), the notetaking process of the humanist remains stubbornly multimodal, harnessing embodied, material, and spatial dimensions of knowledge. The resulting knowledge environments humanists create around themselves resemble life-sized realisations in mixed media of a Prezi stack, a physical manifestation of the fragmented, capricious, haphazard stream of influences jostling for scholarly attention, and the scholar's understanding that their system inter-relationships are complex, sometimes tenuous, and largely undiscovered. This article will lay out the evidence for and implications of this understanding of humanistic reading, and then explore possible future paths for using technology to explore and indeed celebrate distraction, including: Technology as blurring the line between the personal and the professional, not so much as a labour practice, but as an epistemic one opening the way to the validation of ""epistemic emotions"" as a valid research input, but also to the more effective convergence of humanities research with other inputs to the identity formation process of seemingly distracted undergraduates; and research infrastructural implications for libraries (where remote storage and electronic catalogues diminish the likelihood for serendipity, essentially by reducing distraction) but also for vitual research environments founded upon a new understanding of what the ideal humanistic work environment might be and how to get ""below the level"" of that work.";[Edmond, Jennifer] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland;Edmond, J (reprint author), Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.;;;Irish Research CouncilIrish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology;The author would like to recognise the Irish Research Council for their funding of this work, as well as her collaborators on the original SPARKLE Project, Dr Naveen Bagalkot and Dr Alex O'Connor and the anonymous DHQ reviewer.;;18;0;0;0;2;ALLIANCE DIGITAL HUMANITIES ORGANIZATIONS;BOSTON;SNELL LIBRARY 213, NORTHEASTERN UNIV, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA;1938-4122;;;DIGIT HUMANITIES Q;DIGIT.

Commissioned two decades ago by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the work is just back on view to the public after a major restoration.

Nonetheless it remains under-discussed and for those not deeply engaged in DH a bit of a mystery. Drawing on recent DH work and publications that engage with questions of DH collaboration in different ways (e.g. [Deegan and McCarthy] [Griffin and Hayler 2016] [Hayler and Griffin 2016]), we analyse three types of DH collaboration: 1) human-human interactions; 2) human-machine/material interactions; and 3) machine/material-machine/material interactions. We argue that engagement with collaboration processes and practices enables us to think through how DH tools and practices reinforce, resist, shape, and encode material realities which both pre-exist, and are co-produced by them. We suggest that understanding these entanglements facilitates a critical DH in which academic hierarchies and disciplinary preconceptions are challenged.";"[Griffin, Gabriele] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Hayler, Matt Steven] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England";Griffin, G (reprint author), Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden.;;;Nordforsk [81520];Griffin has found this in a project she is currently undertaking on women working in DH, where she is interviewing women and men in DH.

J;Hassapopoulou, M;;;;Hassapopoulou, Marina;;;From Distracted to Distributed Attention: Expanded Learning through Social Media, Augmented Reality, Remixing, and Activist Geocaching;DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;"With the increasing proliferation of digital technologies into our daily routines, long-standing debates have resurfaced on the potential of prosthetic devices to extend our cognitive capacities and distribute intelligence across human and non-human agents. This article will propose ways in which we, as educators, can harness the distractions that new technologies can pose to teaching and research towards productive models of distributed attention and collective intelligence. By reflecting on the relationship between play and pedagogy through critical theory, as well as on the benefits of hyper-connected and collaborative learning, this article hopes to expand the branch of Digital Humanities that Holly Willis terms as the ""cinematic humanities."" Remixing, recontextualization, and the non-linear/non-sequential reconfiguration of information can provide us with new modes of distributed attention and critical making in the digital age. This article focuses on low and no-budget process-oriented collaborative projects for Cinema, Media Studies, and Digital Humanities courses (adjustable to other subject matters) that incorporate remixing, social and locative media, and augmented reality into experimental modes of connected and collaborative learning. The first assignment is a live film scoring remix, where students collectively brainstormed on picking sound clips/samples to add new soundtracks to early silent films. Remixing practices can offer new insights into cinema's legacy and challenge ocularcentric notions of film spectatorship by, in this case, reversing the conventional hierarchy of image-sound into sound-image and reflecting on how our minds attempt to process the impulse of sensory synchronization in cinema. The second sample assignment proposes new ways of using easy-to-learn and accessible GIS (Geographic Information System) and AR (Augmented Reality) tools to create projects related to civic engagement and local/online activism. The drifts from pre-determined learning outcomes are meant to be active disruptions to any prescribed limitations that delimit what digital humanities should or should not be, and other issues that often undermine the potential contributions to digital humanities that derive from the intellectual and material labor that happens in the networked, expanded and distributed classroom. The remix aesthetic, the ""unfinished"" and makeshift nature of these projects is something that I find adds value to this kind of process-oriented pedagogy because it remains in touch with the pre-institutionalized experimental ethos that prompted the formation of the digital humanities and other disciplinary cross-pollinations.";[Hassapopoulou, Marina] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA;Hassapopoulou, M (reprint author), NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.;;;;;;25;0;0;0;0;ALLIANCE DIGITAL HUMANITIES ORGANIZATIONS;BOSTON;SNELL LIBRARY 213, NORTHEASTERN UNIV, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA;1938-4122;;;DIGIT HUMANITIES Q;DIGIT.

Against the backdrop of the recent discussion in the philosophy of science about what models are and what they do, this paper presents a semiotic perspective on models in the framework of Charles S. Peirce's theory of signs that sheds light on the practice of modeling in the digital humanities. As a first step, it is argued that models are icons, i.e. signs that represent their specific objects by being regarded as similar to them; and that there are, in all, three basic types of model, namely ""images,"" ""diagrams,"" and ""metaphors."" A second step explicates relevant implications of this model-theoretic approach, especially as they relate to the digital humanities. In particular, it is shown that models are not identical to the things they represent and that they only represent them partially; that the representation operates on the basis of a mapping relation between select properties of the model and its object; that each model and each instance of modeling has a theoretical framework; and that models are the true basis for genuine creativity and progress in research.";[Lattmann, Claas] Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Klass Altertumskunde, Leibnizstr 8, D-24098 Kiel, Germany;Lattmann, C (reprint author), Christian Albrechts Univ Kiel, Inst Klass Altertumskunde, Leibnizstr 8, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.;;;;;;93;3;3;3;5;GESIS LEIBNIZ INST SOCIAL SCIENCES;COLOGNE;UNTER SACHSENHAUSEN 6-8, COLOGNE, D-50667, GERMANY;0172-6404;;;HIST SOC RES;Hist.

However, through traditional humanities topics such as language and sensory arts, we claim that the idea of information and information processing is part and parcel of the humanistic tradition.

In detail, the approach here described adopts a bi-dimensional vision: considering the model as both a process of abstraction, an interpretation from a certain point of view, and a formal language to implement this abstraction in order to create something processable by a machine. The role of conceptual models - to be converted into ontologies - as a semantic deepening of controlled vocabularies, is the translation of this vision. Ontologies are the models used in domain communities in order to share classes and predicates for conceptual interoperability.

It touches briefly on issues of interdisciplinarity and disciplinary discontinuity. Specifically, it questions the shared basis of the discourse in terms of the terminology that is used and the research literature that is commonly drawn upon. By way of example, the article calls attention to the seemingly forgotten and in any case neglected literature concerned with the conceptualization of models and modelling in science and the humanities that was produced by cyberneticists and philosophers of science in the GDR and the USSR, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. It may be argued that in order to advance the discourse about modelling in the Digital Humanities, the discourse about modelling in the humanities would have to be unearthed and considered first or at least as well, particularly where it already crossed paths with disciplines adjacent to computing.;[Gengnagel, Tessa] CCeH, Artes Grad Sch, Univ Str 22, D-50931 Cologne, Germany;Gengnagel, T (reprint author), CCeH, Artes Grad Sch, Univ Str 22, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.;;;;;;7;3;3;2;2;GESIS LEIBNIZ INST SOCIAL SCIENCES;COLOGNE;UNTER SACHSENHAUSEN 6-8, COLOGNE, D-50667, GERMANY;0172-6404;;;HIST SOC RES;Hist.

The first does so through the creation of an Atlas and Catalogue of female spirituality spaces in Mediterranean Europe between the 11th and 16th centuries, and the second, through the study of the territorial impact of the foundation of monasteries on rural and urban landscapes during the Middle Ages.

A transformation encouraged by the Internet irruption, which not only has improved a better role of society in scientific development but also it has created a new research field focused on the analysis of democratization of scientific process and its social and cultural impact. However, this research area is yet emerging, it just exists a strong academic framework aiming attention at this new field of humanistic research. These scholars indicate, among their conclusions, that open access and public engagement in science enhanced by web 2.0 tools promote the socialization of the scientific process and contribute to the consolidation of responsible research and innovation.

J;van Lieburg, F;;;;van Lieburg, Fred;;;In saecula saeculorum Long-Term Perspectives on Religious History;CHURCH HISTORY AND RELIGIOUS CULTURE;;;English;Article;;;;;;"religion history; longue duree; digital humanities";"CHURCH HISTORY; CHRISTIANITY";This article offers a personal perspective on religious history after the institutionalisation of this field in the History Department at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 2015. In essence and method, religious history is like history of religion(s). In German and Dutch, one can speak of Religionsgeschichte or religiegeschiedenis/godsdienst-geschiedenis. Different terms are in use in English and French, reflecting the different traditions in the disciplines of theology and history. History of religion(s)/histoire des religions is commonly associated with comparative studies of (non-Christian) religions, while religious history/histoire religieuse developed as a specialisation within general history (mostly concerned with Christianity and therefore close to what is known as church history or ecclesiastical history). While understanding religious history as general history with a focus on the religious factor in cultural, social, and political realities, various research traditions should be converged and integrated by means of conceptual exchange, cross-disciplinary approaches, and linked scholarly networks. Given the interest in global dimensions and long-term developments, computer-assisted research of digitalised sources is recommended for doing religious history today.;[van Lieburg, Fred] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands;van Lieburg, F (reprint author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;;van Lieburg, Fred/0000-0002-0532-4616;;;;139;2;2;0;1;BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS;LEIDEN;PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS;1871-241X;1871-2428;;CHURCH HIST RELIG CU;Church Hist.

While a growing number of media and communication studies projects have applied these techniques to corpuses of born-digital journalism, using the same tools to analyse large-scale collections of historical newspapers requires us to overcome additional technological and methodological challenges. Our discussion is framed around a historical case study examining references to the United States in the 19th Century British Library Newspaper Archive. The article begins by highlighting the problems that researchers of both digital and historical journalism face when attempting to deal with an enormous body of evidence. Next, it argues that Topic Modelling offers one potential solution to these problems by providing a way to ""distant read"" the archive. The remainder of the article is divided into five experiments that demonstrate how Topic Modelling can be applied to a series of research questions, each of which is applicable to other projects that might make use of newspaper archives. As well as demonstrating the investigative potential of topic modelling, the article also highlights the practical and technological barriers that currently undermine its effectiveness, particularly when it is applied to archives of historical material.";"[Van Galen, Quintus; Nicholson, Bob] Edge Hill Univ, Dept English Hist & Creat Writing, St Helens Rd, Ormskirk L39 4QP, England";Nicholson, B (reprint author), Edge Hill Univ, Dept English Hist & Creat Writing, St Helens Rd, Ormskirk L39 4QP, England.;;;;;;39;0;0;5;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;2167-0811;2167-082X;;DIGIT JOURNAL;Digit.

Together, they attempted to launch Thought News, a ""philosophical newspaper"" that never saw the light of day. But both before and after that failed project, Ford never stopped developing a vision for the future of the news. Reading Ford is a jumping-off point for experimentations that raise original methodological questions in the field of media history and theoretical developments that speak to contemporary media problems. In that regard, our paper focuses on the methodological experiment undertaken to explore Ford's work: the creation of an automated Twitter account, a ""bot"" that uses text-mining techniques to automatically tweet excerpts from his writings. The paper describes the concrete steps of that remediation: from the delineation of Ford's written work to the gathering and digitization of the material and its transformation into tweetable soundbites. We argue that this combination of close and automated reading offers heuristic elements of surprise to guide the historical inquiry. As the tweets echo the specific genre of today's ""futureof-the-news"" thinkers, they also constitute an attempt to explore the relationship between ""old"" and ""new' media.";"[De Maeyer, Juliette] Univ Montreal, Dept Commun, 90 Ave Vincent dIndy, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Trudel, Dominique] Univ Quebec Chicoutimi, Dept Arts & Letters, 555 Blvd Univ, Chicoutimi, PQ G7H 2B1, Canada";De Maeyer, J (reprint author), Univ Montreal, Dept Commun, 90 Ave Vincent dIndy, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.;;;Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [430-2018-00809];This work was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [grant number 430-2018-00809].;;47;0;0;5;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;2167-0811;2167-082X;;DIGIT JOURNAL;Digit.

This paper aims to focus on the work undertaken in the field of literary translation by the women writers of this period. Design/methodology/approach Mnemosyne is an open-access digital library that allows data modeling for specific collections (women translators, science fiction, etc.) in support of research and teaching on Silver Age Spain. The first version of the library is stored on the server at the Universidad Complutense Library, and it is linked to the collections of the digital library HathiTrust and Biblioteca Nacional de Espana. Behind the scenes of Mnemosyne's public presence online, the project is developing with the aid of the tool Clavy which is a rich internet application that is able to import, preserve and edit information from big data collections of digital objects so as to build bridges between institutional and digital repositories and create collections of enriched digital content. See:http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/queesmnemosine.php Findings The Collection Women Translators in Spain (1868-1936) inside Mnemosyne selects, categorizes and makes visible in digital format women translators and literary translations that belong to a forgotten repertoire to allow the historical review of the period. The digital collection of Spanish Women Translators pretends to be a field of international experimentation for the creation of interoperable semantic networks through which a large group of scholars could generate innovative research and theoretical reading models for literary texts. See:http://repositorios.fdi.ucm.es/mnemosine/colecciones.php Research limitations/implicationsClavy also provides a basic system of data visualization, edition and navigation. There are plans to integrate @Note, a collaborative annotation application, into Clavy. These two computational tools were developed by the software languages research group ILSA[1] at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Practical implications Its been followed NEWW Women Writers' categories concerning biographical categories as successful standard for ensuring interoperability in the near future: children, marital status, social class, religion, profession and other activities, financial aspects, memberships.

The author claims that the engineering knowledge in the technogenic civilization combines science and technology, technology and industry, techno-science and art, economics, society and culture. At the same time engineers and technologists while doing their experimental research face with risks and uncertainty. The author argues that the rise of new global risks as well as the changes in the societal system make especially relevant the problems of resource saving, efficiency, ecological and technological safety. The author insists that the humanities could contribute to the settlement of these problems.

Drawing on my previous work, I argue that an agent's instincts and other drives constitute her psychological type. In this framework, a drive counts as a virtue to the extent that it is well-calibrated with the rest of the agent's psychic economy and meets with sentiments of approbation from the agent's community. Different virtues are fitting for different types, and different types elicit different discrete emotions in people with fine-tuned affective sensitivity, making Nietzsche's exemplarism doubly pluralistic. Exemplars show us how a type is expressed in different social and cultural contexts. Some live up to the full potential of their type, while others are stymied and demonstrate how pernicious influences can wreck a person's psychology. While some exemplars inspire admiration that leads to emulation, others elicit a range of other emotions, such as envy, contempt, and disgust. If this is right, then Nietzschean exemplarism offers a richer, more evaluatively and motivationally nuanced moral psychology than the monochrome admire-and-emulate model currently popular.;"[Alfano, Mark] Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands; [Alfano, Mark] Australian Catholic Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia";"Alfano, M (reprint author), Delft Univ Technol, Delft, Netherlands.; Alfano, M (reprint author), Australian Catholic Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.";;;;;;21;1;1;0;0;UNIV STUDI TRIESTE, EDIZIONI UNIVERSITA TRIESTE-EUT;TRIESTE;VIA EDOARDO WEISS 21, TRIESTE, 34128, ITALY;1825-5167;;;ETICA POLITICA;Etica Politica;;2018;20;2;;;;;45;64;;;;;20;Philosophy;Philosophy;HC3DH;WOS:000451680900004;;DOAJ Gold;;;07/02/2020

If we label the cyberspace as a certain utopia of postmodern symbols, then the cyberspace is the foreshadowing of the World in which digital reality, cyborgs, (non)humanoid robots, and drones will define the level of nonhuman or Transhuman within us.

Methods from the field of Digital Humanities allow us to find new ways to cope with that challenge. Text mining or topic modeling tools offer a new perspective on words and their combination within a text. The following article highlights the relevance of digital methods for historical semantics, using the Latin term virtus and its medieval use as an example.

Furthermore, the parameter design of the visualization tools follows the general procedures and methods for bibliometric analysis. Findings - There is an obviously rapid growth in digital humanities research. English is still the leading academic language in this field. The most influential authors all come from or have scientific relationships with Europe and North America, and two leading countries of which are the UK and USA. Digital humanities is the result of a dynamic dialogue between humanistic exploration and digital means. This research field is closely associated with history, literary and cultural heritage, and information and library science. Research limitations/implications - This analysis relies on the metadata information extracted from the WoS database; however, some valuable literatures in the field of digital humanities may not be retrieved from the database owing to the inherent challenge of topic search. This study is also restricted by the scope of publications, the limitation regarding the source of data is that WoS database may have underrepresented publications in this domain. Originality/value - The output of this paper could be a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners interesting in the knowledge domain of digital humanities. Moreover, the conclusions of this retrospective analysis can be deemed as the comparable foundation for future study.";[Wang, Qing] Nankai Univ, Business Sch, Dept Informat Resource Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China;Wang, Q (reprint author), Nankai Univ, Business Sch, Dept Informat Resource Management, Tianjin, Peoples R China.;;;;;;97;4;4;27;160;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0022-0418;1758-7379;;J DOC;J.

The purpose of this paper is to employ the DID3 projects as a case study to explore the following research question: what roles do librarians and archivists take on in data-intensive, interdisciplinary, and international DH projects? Design/methodology/approach Participation was secured from 53 persons representing eleven projects. The study was conducted in the naturalistic paradigm. It is a qualitative case study involving snowball sampling, semi-structured interviews, and grounded analysis. Findings Librarians or archivists were involved officially in 3 of the 11 projects (27.3 percent). Perhaps more importantly, information professionals played vital unofficial roles in these projects, namely as consultants and liaisons and also as technical support. Information and library science (ILS) expertise helped DID3 researchers with issues such as visualization, rights management, and user testing. DID3 participants also suggested ways in which librarians and archivists might further support DH projects, concentrating on three key areas: curation, outreach, and ILS education. Finally, six directions for future research are suggested.

The global visibility of the African writer, like many academics in African universities, is challenged by digital migration, digital illiteracy or aliteracy. This study problematizes this digital exclusion from the contemporary digital world on account of the multiple dimensions of digital divide; and social and intellectual denial of access to the global literary forum. This preliminary study re-articulates the Nigerian writer's creative environment, production process and distribution of the literary product; using interviews, ethnographic interactions, and observations, to assess the writers' (n: 62) digital literacy, competence, and issues of digital migration. Findings which were analyzed descriptively preliminarily point to the fact that media digitization actually challenges the Nigerian writer in ways that have impacted on his/her competence for literary creation/production, access and distribution within the 'global literary forum'; a situation that may probably be seen as a common disempowering' experience for many creative writers in developing Global South.";"[Betiang, Liwhu; Akpan, Brenda] Univ Calabar, Dept Theatre Film & Carnival Studies, Calabar, Nigeria";Betiang, L (reprint author), Univ Calabar, Dept Theatre Film & Carnival Studies, Calabar, Nigeria.;Betiang, Liwhu -/W-7747-2019;;;;;56;1;1;1;1;HUNGARIAN COMMUNICATION STUDIES ASSOC;BUDAPEST;BOKOR UTCA 1-3-5, BUDAPEST, 1037, HUNGARY;2063-7330;;;KOME;KOME;;2018;6;1;;;;;14;31;;10.17646/KOME.2018.12;;;18;Communication;Communication;GK9CK;WOS:000436534500002;;DOAJ Gold, Green Accepted;;;07/02/2020

With the popularity of digital technology and mobile computing, Digital Human Geography in both theory and practice have emerged many new potentials and development opportunities. However, the research field regarding digital human geography can cover many areas, such as: mobile augmented reality, local media and service design, urban space interaction, virtual mixed space, space humanistic experience, historical materials reproduction, creativity of digital local sense, cultural narrative and art experience, local action games, mobile learning, and location-related business applications etc. This study aims to transfer information to specific groups through a simple and straightforward manner. With digital technology in combination with humane digital contents, people under the scenario of interactive interface are allowed to apply geographic information system (GIS) and geo-fencing program to convert data into visual images and through today's Infographics to clearly use visual design characteristics in content presentation. Therefore, our study was to develop a new App, called ""Ai Guang Zhan"". People can use ""Ai Guang Zhan"" App to integrate all exhibition related services. The App can be downloaded from smartphone or tablet PC for users to search in any time the arts and cultural activities and public facilities in the nearest place and receive instant mobile navigation services among various cultural and creative parks. To understand the preference and satisfaction by the people who use the UI interface for the APP designed from the study, a random questionnaire survey will be conducted in Huashan Cultural and Creative Industry Park and Songshan Cultural and Creative Park. The survey results will be used as reference for function improvement of next APP version. The primary purpose of this research is to propose a model for the development of applications, as well as methods for a clearer and easier visual presentation of information to be used as a reference for practitioners or application designers. The application, developed by the study through the proposed processes, was found to be effective; the developed application could be utilized as a new and useful tool to facilitate the utilization of academic and cultural resources. Additionally, users' specific comments and suggestions collected by the study could be adopted as a reference for future application development. The application developed by this study was found to serve effectively as a method to promote the development of art and cultural activities of all sizes in various regions, and stimulate the exchange of arts and humanities between urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the application has the ability to attract younger people to participate in art and cultural activities, find their own interests, and explore more corresponding activities with its assistance. Future applications associated to art and cultural activities are suggested to effectively integrate AR, GIS, and visual design (such as Infographics) technologies, and thereby offer users more diversified, convenient, and useful functions. Restricted by the resources of labor and limited time, the functional design and development of the application still requires improvement. Specifically, the combination of AR technology and information presentation of art and cultural activities, as well as the calculation of relative distance and travel time were not presented effectively. The next step of the project would involve revising the content and functionalities of the application based on users' feedback collected by this study, reviewing the acceptance of market responses of the application, and seeking a development company or foundation for technology transfer. Moreover, we intend to combine more technologies such as diversified cross-platform functions, visualized design of information, and interactive devices to further improve the application, and thereby stimulate social, human, and geographical interactions.";"[Chiu, Chen-Chiou; Lee, Lai-Chung] Natl Taipei Univ Technol, 1,Sec 3,Zhongxiao E Rd, Taipei 10608, Taiwan";Lee, LC (reprint author), Natl Taipei Univ Technol, 1,Sec 3,Zhongxiao E Rd, Taipei 10608, Taiwan.;;;"Humanities Department of the Ministry of Science and Technology;  [MOST 104-2420-H-027-003]";With grateful to the Humanities Department of the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Granted Program No. is MOST 104-2420-H-027-003.;;20;3;3;5;35;SPRINGER;NEW YORK;233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA;0946-7076;1432-1858;;MICROSYST TECHNOL;Microsyst.

From a Nebraska ranch to MIT, servomechanisms, digital computing and system dynamics, Jay lived his entire life on the frontier, innovating to solve critical problems. Today, more than ever, humanity faces grave threats arising from our mismanagement of increasingly complex systems. Fortunately, progress in system dynamics, the natural and social sciences, computing, data availability, and other modeling disciplines have advanced the frontier in theory and methods to build reliable, useful knowledge of complex systems. We must therefore ask: What would Jay do if he were young today? How would he build on the knowledge, technology, data and methods now available to improve the science and practice of system dynamics? What must we now do to explore the next frontier?

With the impact of globalization, it has become compulsory to increase access to cultural heritage, to ensure participation and to evaluate practices from an international perspective. All these developments contributed to the formation of a new field, approach, in the name of digital humanities. With the studies done in this area, it is possible to have knowledge and interaction with a cultural entity that exists today in any part of the world. While creating the department of this field in the world's leading universities, in Turkey this concept has not been yet known. Although in recent years, there has been an increase in the number of digitalization of cultural heritage by cultural memory institutions, studies carried out within the scope of digital humanities are scarce. Based on this problem, it is aimed to introduce the field by describing what the digital humanities is, what it expresses, its historical development and application areas in the context of the literature in this study. Also studies done in this field in Turkey are evaluated and approaches and practices about convergence with digital humanities and librarianships around the world has been mentioned.;[Akca, Sumeyye] Ardahan Univ, Dept Informat Management, Ardahan, Turkey;Akca, S (reprint author), Ardahan Univ, Dept Informat Management, Ardahan, Turkey.;;;;;;60;0;0;0;0;TURKISH LIBRARIANS ASSOC;ANKARA;YENISEHIR, NECATIBEY CAD, ELGIN SOK, PO BOX 175, ANKARA, 06440, TURKEY;1300-0039;2147-9682;;TURK LIBRARIANSH;Turk.

Between these two extremes are the figures who are the most directly concerned, the photo-reporters. Patrick Chauvel, who was born in 1949, has been an independent war photographer for over fifty years. He has decided to create a structure that will serve to safeguard and diffuse his own work which represents a heritage of considerable historic value, source material for research on nearly half a century of world history. The main challenge was to bring together skills from three different fields of expertise-the press, photography and archives-and to create a common language allowing for dialogue and understanding between them. The first step was simply to gather together the various documents (negatives, slides, traditional prints, objects, notebooks, press cuttings, films, digital files, etc.) which were to be found in several locations, in the collections of Corbis-Sygma and the newspaper France-Soir but also in the reporter's personal affairs. It was then necessary to sort these items by medium and by country, in order to respect the history of their production, and then to classify them by reportage. To create a certain coherence in the use and exploitation of the collection thus reconstituted, an overview was necessary to choose the emblematic pictures and the representative ones to digitise. An index was necessary too, to guide researches in this documentation covering world history. The structure created by the association for the Patrick Chauvel foundation hopes to inspire similar initiatives on the part of other photo-reporters and photojournalists, and to help preserve and render useful these collections which often represent a lifetime's work.;[Fromenteze, Emilie] UVSQ, CHCSC, Versailles, France;Fromenteze, E (reprint author), UVSQ, CHCSC, Versailles, France.;;;;;;6;0;0;0;0;MINISTERE CULTURE & COMMUNICATION;PARIS;3 RUE DE VALOIS, PARIS, 75033, FRANCE;1630-7305;;;IN SITU-REV PATRIMOI;;;2018;;36;;;;;;;UNSP 18413;10.4000/insitu.18413;;;16;Humanities, Multidisciplinary;Arts & Humanities - Other Topics;HB3TK;WOS:000450973900014;;DOAJ Gold;;;07/02/2020

By developing the project, librarians learned how to better support digital humanities by actually doing digital humanities, as well as gaining insight on the variety of approaches taken by researchers and commenters to the idea of the future of libraries. Design/methodology/approach The researchers collected a corpus of over 150 texts (articles, blog posts, book chapters, websites, etc.) that all addressed the future of the library. They ran several instances of latent Dirichlet allocation style topic modeling on the corpus using the programming language R. Once they produced a run in which the topics were cohesive and discrete, they produced word-clouds of the words associated with each topic, visualized topics through time and examined in detail the top five documents associated with each topic. Findings The research project provided an effective way for librarians to gain practical experience in digital humanities and develop a greater understanding of collaborative workflows in digital humanities. By examining a corpus of library-themed literature, the researchers gained new insight into how the profession grapples with the idea of the future and an appreciation for topic modeling as a form of literature review. Originality/value Topic modeling a future-themed corpus of library literature is a unique research project and provides a way to support collaboration between library faculty and researchers from outside the library.;"[Neatrour, Anna L.; Cummings, Rebekah] Univ Utah, J Willard Marriott Lib, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Callaway, Elizabeth] Univ Utah, Coll Humanities, Environm Humanities, Salt Lake City, UT USA";Neatrour, AL (reprint author), Univ Utah, J Willard Marriott Lib, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.;;Neatrour, Anna/0000-0001-8007-9940;;;;204;1;1;7;13;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2059-5816;2054-1694;;DIGIT LIBR PERSPECT;Digit.

Design/methodology/approach The experiences of the authors in collaborating with DH scholars and community organizations is discussed with references to the literature. The paper suggests how research libraries can use existing expertise and infrastructure to support the development of digital cultural heritage collections and DH research. Findings Developing working collaborations with DH researchers and community organizations is a productive way to engage in impactful cultural heritage digital projects. It can aid resource allocation decisions to support active research, strategic goals, community needs and the development and preservation of unique, locally relevant collections. Libraries do not need to radically transform themselves to do this work, they have established strengths that can be effective in meeting the challenges of DH research. Practical implications Academic libraries should strategically direct the work they already excel at to support DH research and work with scholars and communities to build collections and infrastructure to support these initiatives.

Rarely, though, will academic librarians consider how members from the communities that created the materials can contribute to digitization projects. The purpose of this study is to explain how collaboration with Zuni Pueblo (a Native American tribe in the southwest) community members improved a digital humanities project to disseminate Zuni language learning materials. Design/methodology/approach Methodologically relying on critical making, which involved community member feedback throughout the process, the Zuni Language Materials Collection will provide digital access to 35 language learning items. Findings The authors argue that collaboration with members of the community of creation dramatically improved item description, collection discoverability and collection interactivity. This study historicizes CONTENTdm and describes how the team modified this content management system to meet user needs. This project produced a prototype digital collection, collaboratively authored metadata and an interactive portal that invites users to engage with the collection.

J;Hoeve, CD;;;;Hoeve, Casey Daniel;;;Finding a place for genealogy and family history in the digital humanities;DIGITAL LIBRARY PERSPECTIVES;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Libraries; Intersectionality; Cultural analysis humanities; Genetic ancestry; Historical societies; Humanities computing";;Purpose Despite its growing popularity, there is a noticeable absence of references to the inclusion of genealogy and family history studies within the field of digital humanities. New forms of inclusiveness, particularly in production-coding and cultural analysis, closely align genealogy and family history with the core tenants practiced among humanities computing and digital humanities. This paper aims to prove that genealogy as family history should be formally recognized within this cohort, as it can serve as a valuable and innovative partner for advocacy and technological advancement of the field. Design/methodology/approach By examining the literature, genealogy will be defined according to its use in the digital humanities, as well as its use in family history studies. The core tenants of humanities computing and digital humanities will be identified and compared against the research methodology and technological tools used in genealogy and family history research. The comparison will determine how closely the fields align, and if genealogy defined as family history should be used, and included within the field of digital humanities. Findings The progression of genealogy and family history from production to cultural analysis corresponds with the transition of production and coding (influenced by humanities computing) to the inclusion of experimental cultural research adopted by the digital humanities. Genealogy's use of technological tools, such as databases, text encoding, data-text mining, graphic information systems and DNA mapping, demonstrates the use of coding and production. Cultural analysis through demographic study, crowdsourcing and establishing cultural connections illustrates new methods of scholarship, and connects coding and cultural criticism, serving as a bridge between digital humanities and the humanities at large. As genealogy continues to create new partnerships of a collaborative nature, it can, and will, continue to contribute to new areas of study within the field. As these practices continue to converge with the digital humanities, genealogy should be recognized as a partner and member in the digital humanities cohort. Originality/value Despite its growing popularity, there is a noticeable absence of references to the inclusion of genealogy and family history studies within the field of the digital humanities. The term genealogy resonates differently within the digital humanities, primarily articulating the history of the field over the study and research of family lineage. This study seeks to demonstrate how genealogy and family history can fit within the digital humanities, providing a new perspective that has not yet been articulated in the scholarly literature.;[Hoeve, Casey Daniel] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA;Hoeve, CD (reprint author), Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.;;;;;;56;0;0;6;7;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2059-5816;2054-1694;;DIGIT LIBR PERSPECT;Digit.

Through the engagement of individual users, governments, corporations, and even grassroots organizations, the ubiquity of computational technology has a far-reaching impact on social life. Scholarship on digital ethnography has fallen along a continuum between theory and methodology. By shifting the focus of the digital from a subject to a method of research, this article contends for a methodologically centered framework of digital ethnography that can transcend the digital/physical binary that is more fraught in discourse than it is in the human experience of contemporary culture. Within this framework, ethnographers can leverage the digital affordances of scalability and intermodality to uncover new perspectives on field observations and document social and cultural processes with empirical specificity and precision. Ethnographers can use data and new informational discoveries to extend of their field-based knowledge, achieving what I refer to as ""augmented empiricism."" In this article, I examine how working with a variety of digital tools, including webscraping, mapping, and sound visualization, could widen the scope of ethnographic work and deepen our practice.

Authorship attribution nevertheless remains a serious scholarly concern when it comes to the corpus of mystical texts from Groenendaal: because of the general proximity of the Groenendaal authors, their OEuvres can be difficult to delineate. In this paper, Iapply a quantitative, style-based methodology for authorship attribution to a sizable corpus of Groenendaal authors. These computational techniques are borrowed from the innovative field of stylometry in the Digital Humanities. Iwill discuss how the experimental results obtained are able to confirm and complement many of the authorship-related hypotheses developed in traditional Middle Dutch studies.

How can documents produced by ethnography be archived, becoming shared heritage of a wider community and a source of inspiration for many different cultural projects? Following the brief history of a single ethnographic project, the paper articulates a reflection on the evolution of the legal framework in close connection with the opportunities for a collaborative ethnography, attentive to the challenges of restitution and public use of the sources. The new projects linked to the institution, by the ratifying States of the international Conventions, of Inventories of Intangible Cultural Heritage, open the ethnographic research to different scenarios, unimaginable only a decade ago.

Its focus is twofold. The convergence of rapidly expanding digital repositories and databases of family history-related information and increasingly sophisticated online teaching platforms and how this has facilitated a shift from face-to-face to fully online learning and teaching is examined. The ways in which this transformative change was engineered through the unit design, delivery, and evaluative processes are then canvassed. The case study demonstrates how, with thoughtful, well-structured, and innovative approaches to design and by adopting a bespoke delivery model for online delivery, students can readily learn to access and engage critically with extensive online resources and can be equipped with the digital tools to use these optimally and to their satisfaction.;[Harman, Kristyn E.] Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia;Harman, KE (reprint author), Univ Tasmania, Hobart, Tas, Australia.;;;;;;18;0;0;0;0;UNIV WOLLONGONG;WOLLONGONG;NORTHFIELDS AVE, WOLLONGONG, NSW 2522, AUSTRALIA;1449-9789;;;J UNIV TEACH LEARN P;J.

With growing academic interest in the study of the evolution of digital writing on the one hand and the rise of disinformation on the other, the problem of identifying the relationship between texts with similar content is becoming more important. Traditional vector space representations of texts have made progress in solving this problem when it is cast as a reconstruction task that organizes related texts into a tree expressing relationships-this is dubbed text phylogeny in the information forensics literature. However, as new text representation methods have been successfully applied to many other text analysis problems, it is worth investigating if they too are used in text phylogeny tree reconstruction. In this paper, we explore the use of word embeddings as a text representation method, with the aim of trying to improve the accuracy of reconstructed phylogeny trees for real-world data and compare it with other widely used text representation methods. We evaluate the performance on established benchmarks for this task: a synthetic data set and data collected from Wikipedia. We also apply our framework to a new data set of fan fiction based on some famous fairy tales. Experimental results show that word embeddings are competitive with other feature sets for the published benchmarks, and are highly effective for creative writing.;"[Shen, Bingyu; Scheirer, Walter J.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Forstall, Christopher W.] Mt Allison Univ, Dept Class, Sackville, NB E4L 1G9, Canada; [Rocha, Anderson de Rezende] Univ Estadual Campinas, Inst Comp, BR-13026063 Campinas, SP, Brazil";Scheirer, WJ (reprint author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.;;Forstall, Chris/0000-0001-8004-2603;"Sao Paulo Research FoundationFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP); Fapesp under Deja Vu Grant [2017/12646-3]; Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Level Education Personnel, CAPES";This work was supported in part by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation, Fapesp under Deja Vu Grant #2017/12646-3 and in part by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Level Education Personnel, CAPES (DeepEyes Grant).;;32;1;1;2;4;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2018;6;;;;;;41002;41012;;10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2856865;;;11;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";GQ6WJ;WOS:000441868800057;;DOAJ Gold;;;07/02/2020

J;Davidson, G;;;;Davidson, Guy;;;The Gay Novel and the Gay World;JOURNAL OF NEW ZEALAND STUDIES;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;"In a recent review essay, J. Daniel Elam charts the emergence of ""gay world literary fiction,"" a subgenre of the category ""world literature,"" which over the last twenty years or so has become both a marketing strategy for publishers and a ""disciplinary rallying point of literary criticism and the academic humanities."" 1 While Elam's essay is implicitly underpinned by the usual disciplinary understanding of world literature (fiction from potentially anywhere in the globe, translated into English, and studied comparatively), its focus is narrowed to the ""gay world"" within the planetary world-a putatively homogenous, transnational gay subculture enabled by digital connectivity and the flows of global capital. This new gay world is, according to Elam, characterized by atomization: ""From Sofia to Shanghai, authors of gay fiction describe a collection of scattered and isolated individuals, needy but incurious."" The situation has emerged from the ""curious paradox"" that ""visibility and acceptance"" have ""made life better"" for many gay men ""at the cost of community and identity."" ""Gay visibility, with its attendant politics of respectability"" has occurred at the expense of older subcultural institutions like ""the gay bar, the bathhouse, the piano bar, and cruising areas,"" rendering the gay community ""a banally knowable object rather than the product of a passionately forged experience of self-making. In place of the urgent longings of 20th-century queer literature, one encounters a peculiar form of worldly, muted yearning.

A DHI typically serves either researchers of one specific sector of humanities (e.g. history, archaeology) or focused research groups working on specific research topics (e.g. studies on the holocaust, on a specific manuscript), with little or no re-use of tools, services and data that could be shared and successfully adopted to answer research questions of different research disciplines. This fragmentation often represents a barrier to inter-disciplinary research collaborations. We present a technical framework for the federation of DHIs where tools, data, services, and knowledge available from each DHI are shared in an integrated environment where researchers can collaborate on specific research topics by creating customized Virtual Research Environments.;"[Frosini, Luca; Bardi, Alessia; Manghi, Paolo; Pagano, Pasquale] Italian Natl Res Council Pisa, Ist Sci & Tecnol Informaz A Faedo, Pisa, Italy; [Frosini, Luca] Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, Pisa, Italy";"Frosini, L (reprint author), Italian Natl Res Council Pisa, Ist Sci & Tecnol Informaz A Faedo, Pisa, Italy.; Frosini, L (reprint author), Univ Pisa, Dipartimento Ingn Informaz, Pisa, Italy.";;;European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the PARTHENOS project [654119];This work has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the PARTHENOS project (Grant agreement No. 654119).;;41;1;1;0;1;CASPUR-CIBER PUBL;ROMA;CASPUR-CIBER PUBL, ROMA, 00000, ITALY;2239-4303;;;SCIRES-IT;SCIRES-IT;;2018;8;1;;;;;33;50;;10.2423/i22394303v8n1p33;;;18;Humanities, Multidisciplinary;Arts & Humanities - Other Topics;GM8DV;WOS:000438448500003;;DOAJ Gold;;;07/02/2020
J;Sitnicki, M;;;;Sitnicki, Maksym;;;DEVELOPMENT OF A MODEL OF DIGITAL RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES;BALTIC JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC STUDIES;;;English;Article;;;;;;"model of digital research universities; areas of use of digital technologies; modern trends in digital research; research universities";SCHOLARSHIP;"The aim of the article is studying modern trends in digital development and developing a universal model of digital research universities. The methodology of the research is based on the use of methods: analysis and comparison for the study of scientific thought in the field of the introduction of digital technologies in the activities of research universities of systematization in the process of singling out the spheres of use of digital technologies in the activities of research universities; graphics for developing a model of digital research universities. The research results are manifested in the generalized development of global scientific thought for the period of 2011-2018. On the use of digital technologies in research universities in the United States, Britain, Germany, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Italy, South Africa, Brazil, Ireland, Finland, India. The results identify the current trends in global scientific research on the introduction of digital technologies concerning issues: the effectiveness of the formation of students' own curriculum; digitization of scientific information; the emergence and development of digital scholarships in scientific libraries; studying the correlation between the number of downloaded articles from the digital space and the number of new articles being written; a reappraisal of the revolutionary role of digital technologies in the social sciences; the rationale for American scientists to create a new model that provides access to the academic platform for a global society; intensification of the exchange of digital data; analysis and comparison of advantages and disadvantages of digital storages; search for new components of research tools based on the study of digital methods; the global development of digital technologies and the enhancement of the effectiveness of digital research cooperation; the widespread use of the Internet and other digital resources on the activities of research universities to improve the quality and semantic consistency of metadata, allowing to identify the digital preservation of research material. The proposed author's definition of ""digital research university"" harmonized the scientific categorical apparatus in accordance with modern trends in the development of digital technologies in research universities. The practical implications of introducing this category in widespread use will be reflected in the rethinking of the role of research universities and the search for new forms of introducing digital technologies. The difference between the proposed category and the term ""digital university"", already used in scientific consumption, is the wider coverage of the characteristics of research activities of research universities using digital technologies. The systematization of the use of digital technologies in research universities has made it possible to identify ten main areas: automation of the management systems of research universities digitizing literary sources in scientific libraries; automation of the educational process; online teaching; conducting final control; repository of diploma and doctoral thesis; student, teaching and research social networks; implementation of joint research online in digital networks; exchange of scientific data. Identified spheres form a system of digital means for the educational and scientific activities of research universities. Their characteristics allow highlighting the effects that arise in the process of introducing digital technologies in research universities. A three-level model of digital research universities has been developed. It combines nine basic elements: electronic portfolio; digital depository; digital training of teachers and researchers; an online platform for teaching; R&D market; research framing; virtual social networks; digital research networks; evaluation of research quality. The proposed three levels of the model reveal the basic role of its elements for the digital development of research universities and provide: the necessary internal infrastructure; maximizing the effects of using digital technologies; international subjectivization of research universities. The author's definition of each element of the developed model is provided, disclosed their digital purpose, and enriched the categorical apparatus. The practical significance of the developed model is ensuring that the maximum is obtained from the use by the research universities of the digital technologies of the present, and waiting for humanity in a strategic future.";[Sitnicki, Maksym] Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Management Innovat & Investment Act Dept, Kiev, Ukraine;Sitnicki, M (reprint author), Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Management Innovat & Investment Act Dept, Kiev, Ukraine.;Sitnicki, Maksym W/X-3756-2018;Sitnicki, Maksym W/0000-0002-0452-0404;;;;30;1;1;1;12;BALTIC JOURNAL ECONOMIC STUDIES;RIGA;VALDEKU IELA 62-156, RIGA, LV-1058, LATVIA;2256-0742;2256-0963;;BALT J ECON STUD;Balt.

The diminishing interest in literature is an undeniable fact recognized in both Western and Eastern literatures. It is under these not-sorosy circumstances for literary studies that the author of this article reads with great interest the book, Thinking Literature across Continents coauthored by Ranjan Ghosh and J. Hillis Miller, and wishes to join them in discussing the fate and future of literature in the age of globalization and telecommunication.

Following this, the research is focused through a qualitative-quantitative methodology with the collection of 537 questionnaires made up of students and the development of a focus groups with a total of 20 teachers belonging to the University of Cadiz, Seville and Huelva. In this sense, it can be noted, among the most outstanding results, that the use of new technologies in the classroom is taking a visible role, both from the point of view of the student and the professor for teaching in a collaborative manner and to develop a critical attitude to the current context. Therefore, it is important to establish that, in times of digital humanities teachers must seek to empower the university students so that they acquire skills how to enter critical discourses.;"[Rodrigo-Cano, Daniel] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [de-Casas-Moreno, Patricia] Univ Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid, Spain; [Aguaded, Ignacio] Univ Huelva, Huelva, Spain";Rodrigo-Cano, D (reprint author), Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.;Aguaded, Ignacio/R-4281-2016;Aguaded, Ignacio/0000-0002-0229-1118;;;;50;0;0;1;1;UNIV REY JUAN CARLOS, FAC CIENCIAS COMUNICACION;MADRID;CAMINO DEL MOLINO S-N, FUENLABRADA, MADRID, 28943, SPAIN;2444-3239;2174-1859;;INDEX COMUN;Index Comun.;;2018;8;2;;;;;13;31;;;;;19;Communication;Communication;GH6HS;WOS:000433545500001;;DOAJ Gold;;;07/02/2020

The population's choice of values in the use of digital technologies depends on a whole range of factors, including economic, political, social, cultural, and psychological ones. Is the attitude of the respondents to the innovation-driven changes in their lives the same? If it is so, then what factors determine the choice of a particular behavioral pattern in terms of using innovative products and services? This article provides the data of a survey designed to analyze the social characteristics of respondents depending on their attitude to innovative products. The results of a sample survey carried out by the authors in the spring of 2017 in Moscow and the Moscow Oblast were used as an information basis. The surveyed sample comprised 1,115 individuals aged 15 to 86 years, including 55.5% of women and 44.5% of men, which generally corresponds to the age and gender structure of the population in the regions surveyed. The survey was designed to eliminate to some extent the lack of quantitative data supporting the hypotheses about the impact of innovation on the way and quality of life of the Russian population, identify the areas of using innovations, which are the most promising from the point of view of the population, and also identify a group of respondents who are most susceptible to new information technologies. The survey results will help understand the innovative transformations in Russia, assess the demands of the population for, and its satisfaction with, innovative products and services, and determine the prospects for their dissemination. An application of the classification trees method allowed us to identify the main factors that influence innovation activity of Russians: the attitude toward innovation, the experience of using online educational services, and people's age.

An exploration of postcolonial digital humanities methods, this article brings together quantitative textual analysis of news media articles from the United States and United Kingdom, postcolonial theory, and selfie scholarship to explore the representation of Syrian refugees in the news media and their self-representation in selfies. Examining ""migrant-related selfies"" theorized in scholarship on migrant media, I argue that photographs of refugees taking selfies are being marshaled by news media to complement reporting on immigration anxieties within the Global North. On the other hand, ""refugee selfies,"" the images refugees themselves are taking, avoid co-optation into such narratives. They do so, I propose, as a form of self-representation that produces agency, creates communities, and resists the inscription of refugees as objects of knowledge in the digital cultural record.";[Risam, Roopika] Salem State Univ, Salem, MA USA;Risam, R (reprint author), Salem State Univ, Dept English & Secondary English Educ, 352 Lafayette St, Salem, MA 01970 USA.;;Risam, Roopika/0000-0002-0742-7352;;;;33;8;8;2;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1540-5702;1540-5710;;POP COMMUN;Pop.

The transposition of the global public health scenarios (such as strategic designs) - designed in recent decades- into digital molds (digital epidemiology), brought us to inquire on emergence of new ontologies about life. Based on science and technology studies (more precisely, Actor-Network theory), the present article proposes the need to reconsider the techno scientific readings grounded in three main axes: a. bios transposed into data; b. heterotopies in health between virtual-real; and c. the new actors that articulate subjects and subjectivities. These analyses are based on the triangulation of different sources (scenarios and journalistic articles linked to epidemiology, personal interviews and focus groups) with an aim of observing the main articulation mechanisms of new ontology in health, which are reconfiguring the conceptual definition of global health policies.";"[Ioana Gavris, Mariana; Tirado, Francisco] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain";Gavris, MI (reprint author), Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.;;;;;;49;0;0;0;3;UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES;MADRID;CIUDAD UNIV, OBISPO TREJO 3, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN;1549-2230;;;TEKNOKULT REV CULT D;Teknokult.

For this reason, it is currently impossible to develop an Arts Education that does not take into account the relevance of digital culture. In the 21st century, the didactic approach to art requires the implementation of media literacy, visual and audiovisual processes. Media and Artistic Education come together to ensure individual and social transformation. Digital Humanities has much to do with this purpose. They are centred on the empowerment of citizens, made possible through learning and creativity processes. There is an urgent need to adapt Arts Education to digital culture and innovation, artistic and educational, through technological media and screens. This text proposes some conceptual bases that, from an interdisciplinary point of view, allow artistic education that takes into account the characteristics of a prosumer society. This society is immersed in processes of active participation in Social Media, but also tends to info-xication that produces the mass creation and diffusion of images. The transition from an educational and artistic model, eminently manual, to a new reality based on technology and the relational factor, must be considered as a constructionist evolution that allows implementing an integrating approach of old and new approaches. The objective is to consolidate creativity and artistic understanding as a factor for human development and social transformation, essential factors for critical citizenship.;[Marfil-Carmona, Rafael] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain;Marfil-Carmona, R (reprint author), Univ Granada, Granada, Spain.;;;;;;63;0;0;1;3;UNIV COMPLUTENSE MADRID, SERVICIO PUBLICACIONES;MADRID;CIUDAD UNIV, OBISPO TREJO 3, MADRID, 28040, SPAIN;1549-2230;;;TEKNOKULT REV CULT D;Teknokult.

The digital revolution is transforming education industry worldwide. In recent years, extensive debate and research are exploring digital technology, focusing on developing a clear understanding of its capabilities as a platform for making social sciences and humanities applicable to the cyber environment of the twenty first century. The widespread use of social media supported by a rapid growth of the digital culture is making learning ubiquitous by creating, capturing and sharing knowledge. This is enhancing students' engagement and learning efficiency. It is also improving the learner instructor interaction by engaging students in a more meaningful participation in their own education and academic achievement. To accomplish this, both students and instructors need to have the skills and expertise in capturing the positive effect of the digital technology and engaging in the new learning environment. This paper reflects on the new learning environment supported by a curriculum reflecting the digital technology era. It discusses how students at the department of archives at the University of Constantine 2 build on the digital capabilities of social media to engage in independent learning by creating and sharing knowledge.;"[Boumarafi, Behdja; Mettai, Khaled] Univ Constantine2, Inst Lib & Documentat, Constantine, Algeria";Boumarafi, B (reprint author), Univ Constantine2, Inst Lib & Documentat, Constantine, Algeria.;Mettai, Khaled/AAG-5377-2019;Mettai, Khaled/0000-0001-6537-3623;;;;15;0;0;0;4;UNIV STUDI FIRENZE, DIPT STUDI MEDIOEVO & RINASCIMENTO;FLORENCE;PIAZZA BRUNELLESCHI 3-4, FLORENCE, 50121, ITALY;2038-5366;2038-1026;;JLIS.IT;JLIS.it;;2018;9;2;;;;;18;26;;10.4403/jlis.it-12427;;;9;Information Science & Library Science;Information Science & Library Science;GG7EV;WOS:000432862200003;;DOAJ Gold;;;07/02/2020

Communication researchers have been investigating avatars for over twenty years, and an examination of this literature reveals similarities but also notable discrepancies in conceptual definitions. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current debates, methodological approaches, and trends in findings. Our review synthesizes previous research in four areas. First, we examine how scholars have conceptualized the term ""avatar,"" identify similarities and differences across these definitions, and recommend that scholars use the term consistently. Next, we review theoretical perspectives relevant to avatar perception (e.g., the computers as social actors framework). Then, we examine avatar characteristics that communicators use to discern the humanity and social potential of an avatar (anthropomorphism, form realism, behavioral realism, and perceived agency) and discuss implications for attributions and communication outcomes. We also review findings on the social categorization of avatars, such as when people apply categories like sex, gender, race, and ethnicity to their evaluations of digital representations. Finally, we examine research on avatar selection and design relevant to communication outcomes. Here, we review both motivations in CMC contexts (such as self-presentation and identity expression) and potential effects (e.g., persuasion). We conclude with a discussion of future directions for avatar research and propose that communication researchers consider avatars not just as a topic of study, but also as a tool for testing theories and understanding critical elements of human communication. Avatar-mediated environments provide researchers with a number of advantageous technological affordances that can enable manipulations that may be difficult or inadvisable to execute in natural environments. We conclude by discussing the use of avatar research to extend communication theory and our understanding of communication processes.";"[Nowak, Kristine L.] Univ Connecticut, 337 Mansfield Rd,Unit 1259, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Fox, Jesse] Ohio State Univ, 3016 Derby Hall,154 North Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA";"Nowak, KL (reprint author), Univ Connecticut, 337 Mansfield Rd,Unit 1259, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.; Fox, J (reprint author), Ohio State Univ, 3016 Derby Hall,154 North Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.";;;;;;152;12;12;4;16;REVIEW COMMUNICATION RESEARCH;MADRID;REVIEW COMMUNICATION RESEARCH, MADRID, 00000, SPAIN;2255-4165;;;REV COMMUN RES;Rev.

Theorists have not given patterns the attention they deserve. Therefore it is far from clear what patterns are and to what purpose scholars may use them. This paper presents eight propositions on patterns which hold true for patterns found 'by hand' and patterns found 'by computation'. One such is that a pattern is discernible in behaviour when we subject it to the intentional stance, as the philosopher Daniel Dennett argues. Here behaviour is part of an intentional system. This paper's argument is that the patterns found 'by computation' too are part of an intentional system. To substantiate this claim this paper discusses two important examples of detecting computational patterns in the domain of the humanities.;[van den Akker, Chiel] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Art & Culture, Hist & Antiqu, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands;van den Akker, C (reprint author), Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Art & Culture, Hist & Antiqu, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.;;;;;;33;1;1;2;8;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0308-0188;1743-2790;;INTERDISCIPL SCI REV;Interdiscip.

The proposed grounded theory of Systemic Managerial Constraints (SMC) is introduced as a way to understand the influence of neoliberal universities on the information behaviour of ECAs. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative research used constructivist grounded theory methodology. Participants were 20 Australian and Canadian ECAs from HSS. Their information practices and information behaviour were examined for a period of five to seven months using two interviews and multiple check-ins. Data were analysed through two rounds of coding, where codes were iteratively compared and contrasted. Findings SMC emerged from the analysis and is proposed as a grounded theory to help better understand the context of higher education and its influence on ECAs' information behaviour. SMC presents university managerialism, resulting from neoliberalism, as pervasive and constraining both the work ECAs do and how they perform that work. SMC helps to explain ECAs' uncertainty and precarity in higher education and changing information needs as a result of altered work role, which, in turn, leads ECAs to seek and share information with their colleagues and use information to wield their personal agency to respond to SMC. Originality/value The findings from this paper provide a lens through which to view universities as information environments and the influence these environments can have on ECAs' information practices and information behaviour.;[Willson, Rebekah] Univ Strathclyde, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland;Willson, R (reprint author), Univ Strathclyde, Dept Comp & Informat Sci, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland.;Willson, Rebekah/C-3486-2017;Willson, Rebekah/0000-0001-8430-8827;Charles Sturt University [752-2014-0499];The author wishes to thank the participants for taking time out of their busy schedules to participate, along with PhD supervisors, Prof Lisa M.

Modern communication technologies encourage communicants for parallelism and diversity, for the expansion of communicative ways, so nowadays communicants do not seek for integrity and consistency. A special role in creating content for different target audiences today belongs to the ability to tell fascinating but simple stories that reflect the worldview of the addressee. However, the intergenerational gap in Russia is growing every year, not least because of the active introduction of digital communications. That is why it is even called the ""the digital division"". Technologism of communication has increased the communication problems between the younger and the older generations. With digital literacy, many students, being able to target technically, do not know how to create content suitable for different generations. In this regard, the target audiences of ""45 plus"" are especially difficult for students. Nowadays, the authors of marketing texts need not only to be aware of attitudes and values of different social groups and generations, but also to be able to adapt to them through intertextuality, using precedent phenomena and a special kind of metaphor. These speech techniques can be considered a copywriting technique. However, they can be actively used only under the condition of speech and social literacy of the text authors. The authors should create texts as a component of culture, adapting them to the tasks and expectations of the addressee.

Scholars from disciplines such as literature and history are collaborating with scientists from disciplines such as statistics and computer science. Moreover, these interdisciplinary teams often reach beyond campuses to companies as well as local, national, and international public and nonprofit institutions. Surprisingly, the computational research that began in the humanities in the 1950s did not develop an important presence within mainstream scholarship until half a century later. The DH experiences thus far reflect the complexity of both human expression and research collaborations across diverse fields and sectors.

During his lifetime, Smith published two books. In An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), he argued that market behavior was dictated primarily by self-interest. However, his earlier book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759), placed sympathy and benevolence at the center of human social psychology. Reconciling these apparently contradictory views is known as the Adam Smith Problem. This study uses an agent-based model to combine Smith's theories, exploring how social norms affect economic behavior, and vice versa. Although they share many basic assumptions, Smith's works leave important questions unanswered: Theory of Moral Sentiments offers a strong model of how social norms consolidate but lacks a coherent explanation for how norms change over time, and, on the other side, Wealth of Nations does not account for the influence of social norms on commercial transactions nor for the durability of seemingly irrational norms in a context of market competition. Considering both theories together in a single model sheds light on their underlying tensions and exposes instabilities that Smith did not anticipate.;[Gavin, Michael] Univ South Carolina, Dept English, Welsh Humanities Bldg, Columbia, SC 29206 USA;Gavin, M (reprint author), Univ South Carolina, Dept English, Welsh Humanities Bldg, Columbia, SC 29206 USA.;;;;;;28;1;1;0;4;GESIS LEIBNIZ INST SOCIAL SCIENCES;COLOGNE;UNTER SACHSENHAUSEN 6-8, COLOGNE, D-50667, GERMANY;0172-6404;;;HIST SOC RES;Hist.

In this essay we discuss two courses we taught in conjunction with the Religious Soundmap Project of the Global Midwest, a collaborative digital humanities project that we co-directed from 2014 to 2016. Engaging students as contributors to a collaborative digital research project helped them to appreciate some of the key practical, theoretical, and ethical challenges that we face as scholars of religion. In particular, our work together brought to the fore critical questions about definition, classification, and representation. Even more, because they knew their work would be accessible to broader audiences outside the classroom, potentially including the very communities whom they were studying, students were able to perceive the stakes of these questions in ways we had not previously experienced. Incorporating digital tools enabled our students to see themselves as scholars of religion.;"[DeRogatis, Amy] Michigan State Univ, Dept Religious Studies, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Weiner, Isaac] Ohio State Univ, Dept Comparat Studies, Columbus, OH 43210 USA";DeRogatis, A (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Religious Studies, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;;;;;;1;2;2;1;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0048-721X;1096-1151;;RELIGION;Religion;;2018;48;2;;;;;255;261;;10.1080/0048721X.2018.1445601;;;7;Religion;Religion;GB4NP;WOS:000429037500006;;;;;07/02/2020

Although MAVCOR organizes events at Yale and coordinates project cycles involving Yale affiliates as well as scholars from other universities in the United States and around the world, much of MAVCOR's activity is conducted online. MAVCOR publishes a born-digital, open-access double-blind peer-reviewed journal, MAVCOR Journal. It also features a born-digital exhibition space, the Material Objects Archive. In at least two ways, MAVCOR is deliberately interstitial, invested in the connective spaces between both disciplines and technologies. First, the Center emerged from a desire to promote interdisciplinary conversation among scholars of religion, art history, anthropology, and others engaged with our subjects of inquiry. We have aimed to accomplish this goal by shaping a forum for conversation and an archive for mutual use. Second, MAVCOR engages the need to form a space for peer-reviewed content online in a manner that emphasizes the mutually beneficial relationship of print and digital modes of inquiry.

It applies tools associated with the digital humanities to the study of Protestant evangelicalism in order to ask what digital research methods can offer the study of religion. Beginning with the development of a social media computer program called a Twitter bot designed to mimic evangelical ministers on twitter, the article considers how digital scholarship allows the work scholars produce to mirror more closely the religious worlds they study. Next, the article analyzes the results of the program using text analysis software. In documenting trends in the bot's output, the article highlights how digital research methods can help answer long-standing questions in the field as well as potentially ask new ones.

In 2013, a group of scholars working on the planning history of the Paris Region launched a series of four two-day annual international conferences entitled 'Inventer le Grand Paris/Inventing Grand Paris', which were held each December from 2013 to 2016. These conferences sought to expand the knowledge about the planning history of the Paris Region as well as to develop international comparative studies. This initiative was a reaction to the lack of historical depth in the discourse of the main actors of the Grand Paris planning process. It also sought to assemble for the first time and complete the historical research on the overall planning of the greater region, connecting it with research on other metropolitan planning histories. Beyond the conferences, a new website opened in June 2017 giving access to the proceedings but also providing a platform for sharing new historical material and research on this subject.;[Orillard, Clement] Univ Paris Est, LabUrba EA 3482, Ecole Urbanisme Paris, UPEC UPEMLV, Marne La Vallee, France;Orillard, C (reprint author), Univ Paris Est, LabUrba EA 3482, Ecole Urbanisme Paris, UPEC UPEMLV, Marne La Vallee, France.;;;;;;8;1;1;0;1;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;0266-5433;1466-4518;;PLAN PERSPECT;Plan.

J;Miller, A;;;;Miller, A.;;;Innovative management strategies for building and sustaining a digital initiatives department with limited resources;DIGITAL LIBRARY PERSPECTIVES;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Innovation; Project management; Digital scholarship; Library management; Library development; Digital initiatives; Digital humanities";;Purpose The purpose of this paper is to offer and explore innovative strategies for building and sustaining digital initiatives at information organizations. Although the examples provided are based on case studies at an academic library, the practices are rooted in project management principles and therefore applicable to all library types, museums, archives and other information organizations. The innovative strategies on staffing and funding will be particularly useful to organizations faced with monetary and staffing shortages and highlights collaborative management practices. Design/methodology/approach Concept of strategic and collaborative management practices led by an experienced project manager cross-trained in management, technical and soft skills enables the successful development and sustainability of digital initiatives. A cross-trained librarian's management practices of leading the Digital Scholarship Initiatives at a particular university will be examined as a case study and aided with literature supporting the need for digital initiatives leaders to have training beyond the credentials of librarian, curator, archivist or historian in the technologically savvy twenty-first century ecology of information centers. Findings The innovative strategies implemented in the case study yielded increases in the number of hours of digital lab usage, digital projects developed, seminars or workshops presented, attendance of library hosted events, number of programs implemented and awareness on campus, all with limited staff and funding. The variety and level of production and marketing is instrumental to the growth and sustainability of digital initiatives. Practical implications The innovative strategies emphasized in this paper use the concept of borrowed or shared time to start staffing needs and is particularly helpful to organizations that do not have a strong line of dedicated staffing or funding to begin building digital initiatives. Offers small ways to start immediately while setting the stage to plan for big ideas for the future. Originality/value This paper suggests a credentialed information expert, such as a librarian, archivist or curator, that is, also cross-trained in project management and technology is the key to not only successfully leading digital initiatives but is instrumental for its sustainability and the marketing, growth and future of digital initiatives.;[Miller, A.] Middle Tennessee State Univ, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA;Miller, A (reprint author), Middle Tennessee State Univ, Murfreesboro, TN 37130 USA.;;;;;;27;0;0;2;15;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;2059-5816;2054-1694;;DIGIT LIBR PERSPECT;Digit.

J;Vlachopoulou, X;;;;Vlachopoulou, Xanthie;;;Addiction to virtual reality: The uncanny, the pharmakon and the body;EVOLUTION PSYCHIATRIQUE;;;French;Article;;;;;;"Addiction; Virtual worlds; Uncanny; Pharmakon; Body";;Aims. - There are numerous concerns about the increasing use of screens: do screens isolate us, make us violent, or addicted? The aim of this paper is to propose sound theoretical foundations and to open up reflection on the often disproportionate concerns about the use of technical and scientific virtual objects. Methodology. - We base our apprehension of virtual reality and its used on the valuable contributions of philosophy and psychoanalysis. We propose a return to the notions of the uncanny and the pharmakon, and we also look at the place of tools in the history of humanity. The notion of addiction is then discussed, and a review of the contributions of contemporary authors to the literature is proposed. Results. - The notions of the uncanny and the pharmakon highlight an essential aspect in the misunderstandings around the psychopathology of virtual reality: it is often apprehended without taking into account the personal involvement of the clinician via his own approach to virtual realities. These new digital objects are envisaged as tools with a place in the history of technology, and also as cultural objects. The psychopathological issue is apprehended by defining its contours, to avoid the approximations that often characterise the manner in which it is approached. The body emerges as an essential axis in the way the psychopathology,of virtual reality is apprehended, in particular in the asceticism that can be seen in the avoidance of offline contact. Discussion. - The theoretical proposals made here provide new insight into the notion of addiction, which is often misused, creating epistemological confusion. The psychopathologies of virtual reality should be considered with caution, taking into consideration commonplace reliance on tools, the uncanny and the balance between remedy and poison in the pharmakon. Conclusion. - This article explores addiction to virtual worlds through the prism of psychoanalysis, also including other disciplines and approaches via the literature review on the issue. It provides to the reader with the possibility of envisaging virtual reality while at the same time disengaging himself from technophobic preconceptions on this subject. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This essay discusses the project's origins as well as its methodological and epistemological foundations. Alternative Toronto is rooted in twin frustrations: with approaches to Canadian history that ignore its radical edges as well as its feminist, anti-racist, Indigenous and LGBTQ+ struggles; and with U.S.- and U.K.-centric radical histories that fail to consider movements beyond their borders. To counter these tendencies, the project adopts - and adapts - the spirit of Britain's History Workshop movement, which created community-based spaces for collaborative historical inquiry that were open to scholars, independent historians and community members alike. By doing so, it asks how digital tools and a dialogic approach to copyright can be used to democratize the archive as both a site and a process, in keeping with the non-hierarchical principles of its subject. It also hopes that by remediating the audiocassettes, videotapes and print materials that were lost in the transition from analogue to digital formats, the site will encourage contributors and visitors to engage in the radical mediation of Toronto's recent past.";[Radovac, Lilian] Univ Toronto, Inst Commun Culture Informat & Technol, Toronto, ON, Canada;Radovac, L (reprint author), Univ Toronto, Inst Commun Culture Informat & Technol, Toronto, ON, Canada.;;;Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of CanadaSocial Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC);This research was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.;;29;0;0;1;2;ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1030-4312;1469-3666;;CONTINUUM-J MEDIA CU;Continuum-J.

This paper offers an analysis, from a Critical Theory perspective, of a key element of this critique: the theory vs. practice debate, which, in the digital humanities, is translated into the famous ""hack"" vs. ""yack"" motto, where DHers usually call for the pre-eminence of the former over the latter. I show how this debate aims to criticise the social situation of employment in academia in the digital age and can further be interpreted with the culture industry theoretical concept, as a continuance of the domination of the intellectual labour (i.e. yack in this case) over manual labour (hack). I argue that, pushing this debate to its very dialectical limit, one realises that the two terms are not in opposition anymore: the actual theory as well as the actual practice are below their very critical concepts in the current situation of academic labour. Therefore, I call for a reconfiguration of this debate, aiming at the rediscovering of an actual theory in the academic production, as well as a rediscovering of a praxis, the latter being outside of the scientific realm and rules: it is political.";[Magis, Christophe] Univ Paris 08, Cemti, Paris, France;Magis, C (reprint author), Univ Paris 08, Cemti, Paris, France.;;;;;;67;0;0;1;3;TRIPLEC;NORTHWICK PARK;WATFORD RD, NORTHWICK PARK, HA1 3TP, ENGLAND;1726-670X;;;TRIPLEC-COMMUN CAPIT;TRIPLEC-Commun.

J;Stoyanov, V;;;;Stoyanov, Valery;;;When Urania Embraces Cleo. Nonchalantly about History or Eine Einfiihrung in die Streichholzforschung;BULGARIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW-REVUE BULGARE D HISTOIRE;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Mythology; History; Genealogy; Auxiliary Sciences of History; Digital History";;"From the marriage of Zeus with Mnemosyne, the nine classical muses came from. Among them, Urania (the muse of astronomy) and Cleo (the patron of history) were in a peculiar relationship at a time when the inspiration played a fundamental role for the intellectual work which was considered an art. The very name of Cleo (the ""Glorious"") points to one of the concepts for the mission of history to tell about bygone events and to celebrate someone's deeds. This makes it a subjective occupation, the results of which depend on the skills of the narrator and his attitude toward the target object, which is why issues, events and personalities receive conflicting assessments. The acts of Cleo and Urania in antiquity were often mixed up, and this creates confusion in clarifying the relationships of individual characters. But the interaction between the two sisters gave birth to the fruit of a knowledge combining the scent of the universal infinity with poetry united in the essence of history. The very name (from the Greek icnopia - study, knowledge acquired through research) shows that the main task of a historian in his work is to study and verify the information, and only then comes the narrative, dressed in an appropriate form. Sources are of a various nature, so the individual disciplines involved with their analysis are also numerous. Thus, from the embrace of Urania with Cleo, the fundamental disciplines of history were born without which it could not claim to be a science. 1681 is considered to be the birth date of the auxiliary sciences of history. In this year Jean Mabillion's profound work set the beginning of scientific diplomatics and palaeography. Subsequently, other works on the two disciplines were published; genealogy, heraldry, sigillography and historical chronology began to establish themselves as separate scientific and practical fields; over time a number of other specific areas in the study of source material occurred which gave rise to new and new special historical sciences. Then the nineteenth century came, which is perhaps the ""classical century"" of history, when having mastered the critical approach to the past and its sources, seekers of retrospective knowledge attempted to establish the norms in the historical process, and positivism was about to glorify history as a relatively objective science. However, the disappointment in the results, reinforced by the stress accompanying the ruination during the two world wars, contributed to the staggering at the other extreme and overestimation of the subjective moment in the past. Today historical science, as we have known it until recently, still attracts the attention of the general public, but has long since ceased to be a ""fortress of high knowledge"". The walls are dilapidated, the princess is abducted, the treasure of the shattered vault is dragged in an unknown direction and laity barbarians are wandering along the narrow labyrinths of the castle, announcing their own ""truth"" about past times. History has ceded more and more of its territories to science disciplines ""sprouted"" from it, satisfying itself with the role of a ""side dish"" and ""appetizer"" to the main dishes of politology, sociology, culturology, ethnology, anthropology. Still the hope remains that Foucault's pendulum may swing back and the combination of the ""subjectivist"" experience with that of the verifiable ""exact"" sciences may produce a new vision of history not only as a fundamental interpretative science but also as an applicable in practice (experimental) science. The article undertakes a brief attempt to trace the development and critical reflection of the studies of sources in Bulgaria focusing on the achievements of The Auxiliary Historical Disciplines Department at the Unified Centre of History at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, the successor of which is today's Department of Auxiliary Historical Sciences and Informatics. The author expresses concern about the tendency of uncontrolled ""swarming"" of the science, the result of narrow specialization, but he also conveys optimism about the achievement of various qualitatively new forms of collaboration between history and ""exact sciences"" with the help of digital humanities.";[Stoyanov, Valery] Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Hist Studies, 52 Shipchenski Prohod St,Bl 17, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria;Stoyanov, V (reprint author), Bulgarian Acad Sci, Inst Hist Studies, 52 Shipchenski Prohod St,Bl 17, BU-1113 Sofia, Bulgaria.;;;;;;78;0;0;0;0;PUBL HOUSE BULGARIAN ACAD SCI;SOFIA;ACADEMICIAN G BONCEV ST, 1113 SOFIA, BULGARIA;0204-8906;;;BULG HIST REV-REV B;Bulgarian Hist.

J;Boyles, C;;;;Boyles, Christina;;;Making and Breaking: Teaching Information Ethics through Curatorial Practice;DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;"For many years, digital humanists have responded to Alan Liu's call for critical digital humanities. Projects such as #TornApart/Seperados and #PuertoRicoMapathon and pieces like ""Where is Cultural Criticism in the Digital Humanities?"" [Liu 2013], ""All the Digital Humanists Are White, All the Nerds Are Men, but Some of Us Are Brave"" [Bailey 2011], and ""Beyond the Margins: Intersectionality and the Digital Humanities"" [Risam 2015] have paved the way for socially conscious developments in the field. At the same time, pressures from administrators, institutions, and funding agencies often discourage critical engagement in favor of tool development and/or ""high tech"" projects [Boyles 2018]. As such, we often attempt to adapt highly rewarded tech skills, like text, sentiment, and big data analyses, for use in social justice projects. While it is possible for these two aims to be compatible, we do ourselves a disservice when we try to force them together. So, how should teacher-scholars implement an intersectional digital humanities framework in the classroom? Using my own classroom as a case study, I assert that one effective strategy is through curation, which helps students investigate topics such as race, gender, sexuality, disability, and socioeconomic status through the careful selection, arrangement, and presentation of materials. Doing so teaches students to think more critically about the act of curation, by encouraging them to participate in knowledge construction as well as the dismantling of harmful narratives and power structures. While this approach differs from the tool-based pedagogy often utilized in the field, its emphasis on knowledge production, critical thinking, digital literacy, and social justice gives students proficiency in socially conscious methodologies that can be applied to any project. Linking curation to making and breaking, two digital humanities approaches to meaning-making, provides a method for interrogating ""archives of humanity"" and developing a pedagogy grounded in cultural critique and social justice [Sadler and Bourg 2015].";[Boyles, Christina] Michigan State Univ, Dept Writing Rhetor & Amer Cultures, Culturally Engaged Digital Humanities, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA;Boyles, C (reprint author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Writing Rhetor & Amer Cultures, Culturally Engaged Digital Humanities, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.;;;;;;24;0;0;0;0;ALLIANCE DIGITAL HUMANITIES ORGANIZATIONS;BOSTON;SNELL LIBRARY 213, NORTHEASTERN UNIV, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA;1938-4122;;;DIGIT HUMANITIES Q;DIGIT.

J;Bozia, E;;;;Bozia, Eleni;;;Reviving Classical Drama: virtual reality and experiential learning in a traditional classroom;DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;"Over the past decades the advancement of technology and its subsequent introduction to the humanities has led to the development of several applications that enhance study and research in areas such as Classics, archaeology, epigraphy, and linguistics. The focus of digital humanists and other humanities scholars has turned to the efficient storage of information that facilitates search, comparative studies, accessibility, and consequently research. The common point of reference for the aforementioned applications is that they do not involve the need for the scholar to ""physically"" be in a virtual space. In areas, such as archaeology and epigraphy, the creation of projects that provide access to 3D models of the artifacts as well as to virtual replications of ancient sites has resulted in the opening of new areas of research and reconsideration of traditional research issues. Also, [Forte et al. 1997] argue that digital visualizations may make the ancient world more accessible to a larger audience. One may comprehend the structure of a vase and analyze its artistic patterns by zooming and relighting it. A problem that is yet to be considered, though, is how a scholar and a student are to perceive Classical drama, the theatrical space, the distances between the actors, the chorus, and the audience, the logistics of the performance, and the cultural aspects at play. This paper discusses the importance of experiential learning and the use of virtual reality as a means of promoting traditional edification methods, virtually recreating the actuality of the stage, and presents the Magic Mirror Theater, a web application designed to facilitate the study of Classical drama.";"[Bozia, Eleni] Univ Florida, Dept Class, Class & Digital Humanities, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Bozia, Eleni] Univ Florida, Digital Worlds Inst, Class & Digital Humanities, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA";"Bozia, E (reprint author), Univ Florida, Dept Class, Class & Digital Humanities, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.; Bozia, E (reprint author), Univ Florida, Digital Worlds Inst, Class & Digital Humanities, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.";;;;;;92;0;0;0;0;ALLIANCE DIGITAL HUMANITIES ORGANIZATIONS;BOSTON;SNELL LIBRARY 213, NORTHEASTERN UNIV, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA;1938-4122;;;DIGIT HUMANITIES Q;DIGIT.

This journal itself has numerous examples that use visualization tools and techniques within the digital humanities as a tool for exploration [Roberts-Smith et al. 2013] [Hoyt, Ponto, and Roy 2014] [Forlini, Hinrichs, and Moynihan 2016]. This boom in attention has led large new populations of learners into the field. Formal educational settings have rushed to create new approaches and introductions to this content, but often they fall back on traditional approaches to things such as scientific charting and graphing [Webber et al. 2014] [Calzada and Marzal 2013]. Many view data visualization as a new technology, which runs the risks of replicating old approaches without acknowledging the unique affordances and domains that data visualization relies upon. Data visualization is not simply another technology to integrate into education. It is visual argument and persuasion, far more closely associated with rhetoric and writing than spreadsheets [Zer-Aviv 2014]. In this paper we present novel approaches to learning technologies and activities, focused on novice learners entering the field of data driven storytelling. We begin with a deeper dive into the problems we see with introducing new learners into a field characterized by inequality, continue with a discussion of approaches for introducing technologies to education, and summarize the inspirational pedagogies we build on. We then offer some design principles and three activities as examples of the concept of creative data literacy. We assert that creative approaches grounded in constructionist educational theories are necessary to empower non-technical learners to be able to tell stories and argue for change with data.;"[D'Ignazio, Catherine] Emerson Coll, Boston, MA 02116 USA; [Bhargava, Rahul] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA";D'Ignazio, C (reprint author), Emerson Coll, Boston, MA 02116 USA.;;;;;;80;0;0;0;0;ALLIANCE DIGITAL HUMANITIES ORGANIZATIONS;BOSTON;SNELL LIBRARY 213, NORTHEASTERN UNIV, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA;1938-4122;;;DIGIT HUMANITIES Q;DIGIT.

J;"Hepworth, K; Church, C";;;;"Hepworth, Katherine; Church, Christopher";;;Racism in the Machine: Visualization Ethics in Digital Humanities Projects;DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Data visualizations are inherently rhetorical, and therefore bias-laden visual artifacts that contain both explicit and implicit arguments. The implicit arguments depicted in data visualizations are the net result of many seemingly minor decisions about data and design from inception of a research project through to final publication of the visualization. Data workflow, selected visualization formats, and individual design decisions made within those formats all frame and direct the possible range of interpretation, and the potential for harm of any data visualization. Considering this, it is imperative that we take an ethical approach to the creation and use of data visualizations. Therefore, we have suggested an ethical data visualization workflow with the dual aim of minimizing harm to the subjects of our study and the audiences viewing our visualization, while also maximizing the explanatory capacity and effectiveness of the visualization itself. To explain this ethical data visualization workflow, we examine two recent digital mapping projects, Racial Terror Lynchings and Map of White Supremacy Mob Violence.;"[Hepworth, Katherine] Univ Nevada, Reynolds Sch Journalism, Visual Journalism, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Church, Christopher] Univ Nevada, Hist, Colonial Environm & Digital Hist, Reno, NV 89557 USA";Hepworth, K (reprint author), Univ Nevada, Reynolds Sch Journalism, Visual Journalism, Reno, NV 89557 USA.;;;;;;39;0;0;0;0;ALLIANCE DIGITAL HUMANITIES ORGANIZATIONS;BOSTON;SNELL LIBRARY 213, NORTHEASTERN UNIV, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA;1938-4122;;;DIGIT HUMANITIES Q;DIGIT.

J;Papaelias, A;;;;Papaelias, Amy;;;Best Practices: Teaching Typographic Principles to Digital Humanities Audiences;DIGITAL HUMANITIES QUARTERLY;;;English;Article;;;;;;;;Typography, the arrangement and use of type, permeates our visual landscape, from printed pages and digital interfaces to physical environments and interactive experience. Those who study and work in the digital humanities are called upon to make typographic choices everyday, yet few have any training in how to effectively design with type. Over the past several years, I have been involved in several initiatives that seek to help educate digital humanities scholars, technologists and students about the value of information design, including typography. This paper will discuss these experiences and some guiding principles for helping a digital humanities audience understand the basic principles of typography and apply them to their projects and research.;[Papaelias, Amy] SUNY Coll New Paltz, Graph Design, New Paltz, NY 12561 USA;Papaelias, A (reprint author), SUNY Coll New Paltz, Graph Design, New Paltz, NY 12561 USA.;;;;;;14;0;0;0;0;ALLIANCE DIGITAL HUMANITIES ORGANIZATIONS;BOSTON;SNELL LIBRARY 213, NORTHEASTERN UNIV, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA;1938-4122;;;DIGIT HUMANITIES Q;DIGIT.
